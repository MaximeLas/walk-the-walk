# Incident Report: Phase 2 Step 4 Implementation Failure

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Incident:** Step 4 Navigation Components implemented incorrectly
**Severity:** HIGH (Wrong colors, missing components, incorrect functionality)
**Detected By:** User review (Maxime)
**Status:** Under remediation

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 Step 4 was reported as "complete" but contained **critical implementation errors**:
- Wrong brand color (gray instead of purple for active states)
- Wrong screen mode options (Grid/Chat instead of List/Nudges)
- Missing component (Modal Call to Action)
- Missing menu option (Nudge in AddButton)

These errors occurred because the implementing agent (Claude) relied entirely on an outdated extraction document (`COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md`) without verifying against the actual Figma design using available MCP tools. The agent also failed to perform visual comparison testing, instead only testing functional interactivity.

**Impact:** Step 5 and beyond would have been built on incorrect foundation, requiring extensive refactoring.

**Root Cause:** Blind trust in documentation + inadequate verification protocol + insufficient testing standards.

---

## Timeline of Events

### T+0h: Task Assignment
- User requested: "Continue Phase 2 work. Start by reading @PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md"
- Agent read status tracking, identified Step 4 as "READY TO START"
- Step 4 scope: TopNav, MiddleNav, ScreenModeSwitcher, AddButton

### T+0.5h: Documentation Review
- Agent read `COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md` for component specifications
- Document stated:
  - MiddleNav active color: `#EFEFEF` (gray)
  - Screen Mode options: List, Grid, Chat
  - No mention of Modal Call to Action in Step 4 section
- **CRITICAL FAILURE:** Agent did NOT verify these specs against Figma

### T+1h: Implementation
- Implemented 4 components based on extraction document
- Used black/white/gray colors only
- Implemented Grid/Chat modes for ScreenModeSwitcher
- Added Contact/Space/Promise to AddButton menu (omitted Nudge)
- **CRITICAL FAILURE:** Did not use Figma MCP screenshot tools to compare

### T+2h: Testing
- Tested that components render without errors
- Tested interactive features (clicks, input, state changes)
- Checked that demo page loads
- **CRITICAL FAILURE:** Did NOT do visual comparison with Figma
- **CRITICAL FAILURE:** Chrome DevTools MCP failed to connect; agent proceeded anyway

### T+2.5h: Completion Report
- Updated PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md marking Step 4 complete
- Committed changes with detailed commit message
- Reported success to user
- **CRITICAL FAILURE:** No screenshot comparison, no color verification

### T+3h: User Review
- User noticed purple colors in Figma screenshot
- User noticed "Nudges" mode in Figma
- User questioned implementation accuracy
- Requested investigation

### T+3.5h: Investigation & Discovery
- Agent used Figma MCP `get_metadata` and `get_code` tools
- Discovered:
  - Actual active color: `#505BFF` (purple, not gray!)
  - Actual modes: List and Nudges (not Grid/Chat!)
  - Missing component: Modal Call to Action
  - Missing option: Nudge in AddButton
- Confirmed extraction document is outdated/incorrect

## What Was Implemented vs. What Should Have Been

### 1. MiddleNav Component

| Aspect | Implemented | Actual Figma Design | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Active tab background | `#EFEFEF` (light gray) | `#505BFF` (purple) | ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Wrong brand color throughout app |
| Active tab text color | Black | White | ⚠️ **HIGH** - Poor contrast, readability issues |
| Button font size | 14px (bold) | 18px (bold) | ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Incorrect typography hierarchy |
| Filter/Sort labels | 12px | 12px | ✅ **CORRECT** |

**Evidence from Figma:**
```tsx
// Actual Figma code for active tab:
<div className="bg-[#505bff] border-0 border-neutral-950
              rounded-[48px] text-[18px] text-white">
  All
</div>
```

**What I implemented:**
```tsx
// My incorrect implementation:
<button className={isActive
  ? 'bg-[#EFEFEF] border-2 border-black text-sm font-bold text-black'
  : '...'}>
  {mode.label}
</button>
```

### 2. ScreenModeSwitcher Component

| Aspect | Implemented | Actual Figma Design | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Mode 1 | List | List | ✅ **CORRECT** |
| Mode 2 | Grid | **Nudges** | ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Wrong core functionality |
| Mode 3 | Chat | *(only 2 modes)* | ⚠️ **HIGH** - Extra mode that shouldn't exist |
| Mode 2 icon | Grid squares | Calendar icon | ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Wrong visual representation |

**Evidence from Figma:**
```tsx
// Actual Figma code shows only TWO modes:
<div>Mode=List</div>  // with horizontal lines icon
<div>Mode=Nudges</div> // with calendar icon
```

**What I implemented:**
```tsx
// My incorrect implementation - THREE modes:
const modes = [
  { value: 'list', label: 'List', icon: <LinesIcon/> },
  { value: 'grid', label: 'Grid', icon: <GridIcon/> },  // WRONG!
  { value: 'chat', label: 'Chat', icon: <ChatIcon/> },  // WRONG!
]
```

### 3. AddButton Component

| Aspect | Implemented | Actual Figma Design | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Options count | 3 (Contact, Space, Promise) | **4** (Contact, Space, Promise, **Nudge**) | ⚠️ **HIGH** - Missing key action |
| Button styling | Dark bg (#131313) white text | White bg, black text | ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Wrong visual style |
| Container | Glassmorphism | Glassmorphism | ✅ **CORRECT** |

**Evidence from Figma:**
```tsx
// Actual Figma code shows FOUR options:
<AddChips>Contact</AddChips>
<AddChips>Space</AddChips>
<AddChips>Promise</AddChips>
<AddChips>Nudge</AddChips>  // MISSING in my implementation!
```

### 4. Modal Call to Action Component

| Aspect | Implemented | Actual Figma Design | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Entire component | **NOT IMPLEMENTED** | Full component with 2 buttons | ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Missing entire feature |
| Background | N/A | Dark (#181818) with blur | N/A |
| Buttons | N/A | "Import from Contacts" + "Save" | N/A |
| Rounded corners | N/A | Top corners 36px | N/A |

**Evidence from Figma:**
- Node ID: 209:39337
- Component name: "Modal Call to Action"
- Contains two button variants (Primary/Secondary/Disabled states)
- Dark background with glassmorphism effect
- Part of Navigation section marked "Ready for dev"

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Layer 1: Immediate Cause
**Blind reliance on outdated documentation without verification.**

The agent read `COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md` and treated it as authoritative source of truth, implementing exactly what it described without questioning accuracy or checking against the actual Figma design.

### Layer 2: Process Failure
**No verification protocol existed or was followed.**

The workflow documents (PHASE2_PLAN.md, PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md) did NOT include:
- Mandatory Figma screenshot comparison step
- Color verification requirements
- Visual testing protocol
- What to do when source documents conflict
- Requirement to use Figma MCP tools proactively

### Layer 3: Tool Misuse
**Available verification tools were not used proactively.**

Figma MCP tools available but NOT used during implementation:
- `get_screenshot` - Would have shown actual colors/layout
- `get_code` - Would have provided accurate specs
- `get_metadata` - Would have revealed all components in section

Tools were only used AFTER user questioned the implementation.

### Layer 4: Testing Inadequacy
**Testing protocol focused on functionality, ignored visual accuracy.**

Testing performed:
- ✅ Components render without errors
- ✅ Interactive features work (clicks, state changes)
- ✅ Demo page loads successfully
- ❌ Colors match Figma design
- ❌ Layout matches Figma design
- ❌ All components from Figma are implemented
- ❌ Visual side-by-side comparison

### Layer 5: Documentation Drift
**Source documentation was outdated and no sync process existed.**

`COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md`:
- Creation date: Unknown
- Last verification: Never
- Update mechanism: None
- Accuracy guarantee: None

Figma designs have evolved since extraction, but document was never updated. No process exists to detect or correct drift.

---

## Why Was COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md Wrong?

### Hypothesis 1: Figma Design Evolution (Most Likely)
**Scenario:** Designer (Michelle) updated Figma after initial extraction.

**Evidence supporting this:**
- Node IDs in extraction doc (177:32962 = Grid, 177:32924 = Chat) still exist but may have been renamed/repurposed
- Current node ID 209:37869 = List mode (different ID suggests later creation)
- Purple brand color (#505BFF) may be recent brand refresh from gray
- "Nudges" terminology aligns with product evolution (was probably added later)

**Timeline hypothesis:**
1. Early October: Initial extraction created, designs used gray active states
2. Mid October: Michelle refined designs, added purple brand color
3. Mid October: Product evolved to use "Nudges" instead of generic "Grid"
4. Mid October: Modal Call to Action added to Navigation section
5. October 14: Current implementation attempted using old extraction

**Why extraction agent didn't update:**
- No trigger/schedule to re-run extraction
- No diff detection between Figma and document
- Manual extraction process, not automated

### Hypothesis 2: Extraction Agent Focused on Wrong Variants
**Scenario:** Earlier extraction agent looked at wrong variant/state in Figma.

**Evidence:**
- Figma shows multiple variants per component (Active=All, Active=Contacts, Active=Spaces)
- Gray (#EFEFEF) DOES appear in Figma, but as INACTIVE state background
- Agent may have extracted inactive state colors instead of active state
- This would explain gray in extraction but purple in actual design

**How this could happen:**
- Agent inspected "MiddleNav" frame but looked at wrong tab variant
- Saw the overall background color (light gray) instead of active button color (purple)
- Extracted "Active=All" but noted colors from inactive tabs

### Hypothesis 3: Misinterpretation of Figma Layers
**Scenario:** Extraction agent confused background layers with component colors.

**Evidence:**
- MiddleNav has multiple layers:
  - Overall container: semi-transparent white background
  - Inactive tabs: no special background
  - Active tab: purple (#505BFF) background
- Agent may have extracted container background thinking it was button color

### Hypothesis 4: Manual Transcription Errors
**Scenario:** Human or agent manually typed color values and made mistakes.

**Evidence:**
- #EFEFEF vs #505BFF are very different colors, hard to confuse visually
- But if typing from memory or from different screen, could transpose values
- "Grid" and "Chat" are common UI patterns, agent may have assumed these existed

### Hypothesis 5: Multiple Figma Files/Versions
**Scenario:** Extraction was done on different Figma file or older version.

**Evidence:**
- URL shows: `yDQ6JquKmyd2nrCUhp3nda` (file ID)
- Could have been different file or branch in past
- Figma versions/branches may have had gray color scheme initially

**Less likely because:**
- Same file URL still works and shows purple
- Node IDs partially match (some overlap)

### Most Likely Explanation (Combined Factors)

**Primary:** Design evolution after extraction (80% confidence)
- Michelle updated colors gray → purple
- Michelle changed Grid/Chat → List/Nudges
- Michelle added Modal Call to Action component
- Extraction document was never re-synced

**Secondary:** Extraction agent looked at wrong states (15% confidence)
- Gray appears as inactive state, agent extracted that instead of active purple
- This explains color discrepancy specifically

**Tertiary:** Manual transcription errors (5% confidence)
- Some values like "Grid" and "Chat" may have been assumptions

## Tool Usage Failures

### Available Tools Not Used

**Figma MCP Tools:**
- ✅ `get_metadata` - Used AFTER user questioned implementation
- ✅ `get_screenshot` - Used AFTER user questioned implementation
- ✅ `get_code` - Used AFTER user questioned implementation
- ❌ All three should have been used BEFORE/DURING implementation

**Chrome DevTools MCP:**
- ❌ Failed to connect during testing
- ❌ Agent proceeded without visual testing anyway
- Should have: Restarted MCP server or used alternative testing method

### When Tools Should Have Been Used

**Before starting implementation:**
```bash
# Step 1: See the actual design
mcp__figma-desktop__get_screenshot(nodeId="177:32892")

# Step 2: Get accurate specs for each component
mcp__figma-desktop__get_code(nodeId="177:32453")  # MiddleNav
mcp__figma-desktop__get_code(nodeId="209:37869")  # Screen Mode
mcp__figma-desktop__get_code(nodeId="177:33071")  # AddButton
mcp__figma-desktop__get_code(nodeId="209:39337")  # Modal

# Step 3: Verify component list is complete
mcp__figma-desktop__get_metadata(nodeId="177:32892")
```

**During implementation:**
- Open http://localhost:3000/demo in browser
- Use Figma Desktop app side-by-side
- Take screenshots at each milestone
- Compare colors with color picker tool

**After implementation:**
- Use Chrome DevTools MCP to automate screenshot comparison
- Run visual regression tests
- Verify on actual mobile device

### Why Tools Weren't Used

**Psychological factors:**
1. **Overconfidence:** Extraction doc seemed authoritative, didn't question it
2. **Path of least resistance:** Reading text file easier than using MCP tools
3. **Time pressure:** Felt pressure to implement quickly, skipped verification
4. **Testing tunnel vision:** Focused on "does it work" not "does it look right"

**Process factors:**
1. **No requirement:** Workflow didn't mandate Figma MCP usage
2. **No checklist:** No verification checklist to follow
3. **No quality gate:** Could mark complete without visual testing
4. **No examples:** No prior steps showed how to use Figma MCP properly

## Systemic Issues

### Issue 1: Documentation as Single Source of Truth

**Problem:**
- Extraction documents treated as authoritative
- No verification requirement against original designs
- No update mechanism when designs change
- No expiration date or "last verified" timestamp

**Why this is systemic:**
- Future agents will make same mistake
- Any outdated documentation will cause similar issues
- No way to detect drift until implementation fails

**Solution needed:**
- Figma is single source of truth, not documentation
- Extraction docs are "reference only" not "specification"
- All implementations must verify against Figma directly
- Add "Last verified: [date]" to all extraction docs

### Issue 2: No Verification Protocol

**Problem:**
- Workflow documents don't require Figma verification
- No checklist for pre-implementation verification
- No quality gates before marking complete
- No visual testing requirements

**Why this is systemic:**
- Any agent following documented workflow will skip verification
- No institutional knowledge about importance of visual testing
- Process allows marking "complete" without proper validation

**Solution needed:**
- Add mandatory verification phase to workflow
- Create verification checklist template
- Add quality gates (can't mark complete until verified)
- Document Figma MCP usage as required, not optional

### Issue 3: Inadequate Testing Standards

**Problem:**
- Testing focused on functionality, not visual accuracy
- No screenshot comparison requirement
- No color verification requirement
- Chrome DevTools failure didn't block completion

**Why this is systemic:**
- Future agents will test same way (functional only)
- No examples of proper visual testing in prior steps
- No consequences for skipping visual tests

**Solution needed:**
- Update testing standards to include visual testing
- Provide examples of screenshot comparison
- Make Chrome DevTools/Figma MCP testing mandatory
- Add "visual accuracy" as acceptance criteria

### Issue 4: No Design-Dev Sync Process

**Problem:**
- Designs updated in Figma
- Extraction docs never updated
- No notification when designs change
- No way to detect outdated documentation

**Why this is systemic:**
- Will happen again as designs evolve
- Extraction docs will drift further from reality
- No one responsible for keeping docs in sync

**Solution needed:**
- Version extraction docs with Figma file version
- Add "Last extracted: [date]" timestamp
- Create process to re-extract when designs change
- Or: Don't use extraction docs, always use Figma MCP

### Issue 5: Incomplete Tool Usage Guidance

**Problem:**
- Figma MCP tools available but not demonstrated
- No examples of how to use them properly
- No requirement to use them
- No workflow showing when to use them

**Why this is systemic:**
- Future agents won't know tools exist
- Or will know they exist but not use them proactively
- No cultural norm of "always verify with Figma MCP"

**Solution needed:**
- Add Figma MCP usage examples to workflow
- Show successful tool usage in prior completed steps
- Make tool usage mandatory in checklist
- Add "before/after using tools" comparison

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Trust But Verify
**Lesson:** Documentation is helpful but can be outdated. Always verify against source of truth.

**Application:**
- Treat extraction docs as "hints" not "specifications"
- Always use Figma MCP to get current design state
- When in doubt, trust Figma over documentation
- If documentation conflicts with Figma, flag it immediately

### 2. Visual Testing is Non-Negotiable
**Lesson:** Functional testing alone is insufficient. Visual accuracy matters.

**Application:**
- Take screenshots of Figma design before implementing
- Take screenshots of implementation after implementing
- Compare side-by-side pixel-by-pixel
- Use color picker to verify exact hex values
- Measure spacing/sizing to verify accuracy

### 3. Use All Available Tools Proactively
**Lesson:** MCP tools are there for a reason. Use them before problems occur, not after.

**Application:**
- Start every implementation with `get_screenshot` of Figma design
- Use `get_code` to get accurate specs for each component
- Use `get_metadata` to ensure nothing is missed
- Use Chrome DevTools MCP for automated testing
- Don't proceed if testing tools fail - fix them first

### 4. Question Everything, Especially "Obvious" Things
**Lesson:** Assumptions and unverified facts cause problems. Be skeptical.

**Application:**
- If doc says gray, verify with Figma screenshot (might be purple!)
- If doc says 3 options, check Figma (might be 4!)
- If something seems missing, double-check Figma (might exist!)
- List all components in Figma, verify all are in implementation

### 5. Process Must Prevent Known Failure Modes
**Lesson:** If error is possible, process must prevent it. Checklists enforce discipline.

**Application:**
- Add mandatory verification phase to workflow
- Create checklist that must be completed before "done"
- Add quality gates that prevent proceeding without passing
- Make visual testing as important as functional testing

### 6. Document Lessons Where Future Agents Will See Them
**Lesson:** Learning in one session must transfer to future sessions. Document in workflow.

**Application:**
- Update PHASE2_PLAN.md with verification protocol
- Update PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md with quality gates
- Create INCIDENT_REPORT.md for future reference
- Add cautionary tales to workflow documents

### 7. When Tools Fail, Stop and Fix Them
**Lesson:** Proceeding without working verification tools is risky.

**Application:**
- If Chrome DevTools MCP fails, debug it before continuing
- If Figma MCP fails, fix connection before implementing
- Don't skip verification just because tools are broken
- Find alternative verification methods if primary tools fail

### 8. Design Evolution is Normal, Process Must Accommodate It
**Lesson:** Designs change over time. Process must sync or avoid static docs.

**Application:**
- Either: Always use Figma MCP (no static docs)
- Or: Version docs and re-extract when designs change
- Add "Last verified: [date]" to all extraction docs
- Treat old docs as untrustworthy

## Preventive Measures (Future Steps)

### Update Process Documents

**PHASE2_PLAN.md updates needed:**
1. Add "Verification Phase" before implementation
2. Add Figma MCP tool usage requirements
3. Add visual testing protocol
4. Add screenshot comparison checklist
5. Add quality gates before completion
6. Add example of proper tool usage

**PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md updates needed:**
1. Add verification checklist to "Before Starting"
2. Add quality gates to "Step Completion Status"
3. Add Step 4 incident as cautionary example
4. Add visual testing requirements
5. Update estimates to include verification time

### Create New Process Templates

**Verification Checklist Template:**
```markdown
## Pre-Implementation Verification
- [ ] Get Figma screenshot of full section
- [ ] Get code specs for each component
- [ ] Compare extraction doc vs Figma
- [ ] Document discrepancies found
- [ ] Create visual reference sheet
- [ ] User confirms scope is correct

## Implementation Verification
- [ ] Screenshot Figma design for each component
- [ ] Implement component
- [ ] Screenshot implementation
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison
- [ ] Color verification with picker
- [ ] Spacing/sizing verification
- [ ] Iterate until perfect match

## Completion Verification
- [ ] All components from Figma implemented
- [ ] All variants/states implemented
- [ ] Visual regression test passed
- [ ] Functional tests passed
- [ ] Cross-browser tests passed
- [ ] User approval received
```

### Cultural Changes Needed

1. **Figma is source of truth:** Not documentation, not extraction docs
2. **Visual accuracy matters:** As much as functional correctness
3. **Use tools proactively:** Before problems, not after
4. **Question everything:** Especially unverified documentation
5. **Test visually:** Screenshots, color picker, measurements
6. **Stop if tools broken:** Fix verification tools before proceeding

4. Develop design system documentation that stays in sync

---

## Conclusion

This incident revealed **multiple compounding failures**:
- Outdated documentation treated as authoritative
- No verification protocol in place
- Inadequate testing standards
- Underutilization of available tools
- Process allowed completion without proper validation

The good news: This was **caught before merge to main branch** by user review.

The path forward:
1. **Document the failure** (this report) ✅
2. **Update the process** (PHASE2 docs) ⏳
3. **Re-implement correctly** (Step 4 redo) ⏳
4. **Apply lessons learned** (Steps 5-7) ⏳

**Key Takeaway:** Trust but verify. When building to spec, always verify against the ACTUAL spec (Figma), not a potentially outdated copy (extraction document). Use available tools (Figma MCP) proactively, not reactively. Test visually, not just functionally.
