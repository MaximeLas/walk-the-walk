## 2025-10-11: Claude Code Context Management Deep Dive

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-11-claude-code-context-management-deep-dive.md](sessions/2025-10-11-claude-code-context-management-deep-dive.md)

**Summary:** Max asked for explanation of latest Claude Code release notes focusing on MCP features. Evolved into comprehensive education on context window mechanics, token economics, and optimization strategies. Started with MCP release history (v0.2.31 through v2.0.14), explained @-mentions evolution (files → folders → MCP resources → agents → MCP servers). Max skeptical whether @-mention toggle actually works - demanded evidence. Empirically verified: MCP tools dropped from 32.4k to 17.5k tokens (15k saved) by toggling off supabase and chrome-devtools. Deep dive into how context windows actually work: traditional accumulation model vs Claude Code's prompt caching. System prompt sent once and cached (5 min TTL), subsequent turns pay ~10% cache read cost ($0.30/1M vs $3/1M write). Context has three layers: System (cached static), Messages (growing dynamic), Cache (invisible infrastructure). Explored all tool types: System tools (11.9k, always on), MCP tools (variable, toggleable), Custom agents (minimal, off-budget via Task tool), Slash commands (~1k), Memory files (1.7k). Calculated actual costs: 20-turn conversation with full MCP costs ~$0.21, with reduced MCP ~$0.15, savings $0.06. Key insight: output tokens are 80%+ of cost ($15/1M) - typical response $0.03, cache read $0.0009. Optimization priority stack: (1) output length 5x leverage, (2) tool result size 3x, (3) message history 2x, (4) system prompt 0.1x. Conclusion: at 58k/200k (29%) usage, optimization is premature. Use lazy toggle approach - only disable MCP when hitting 70%+ context. MCP toggle exists for context management in long sessions (100+ turns), not cost/performance. Custom agents are "off-budget" - separate 200k context via Task tool, only summary returns to main. Developed four frameworks: Three-Layer Context Architecture, Cost Optimization Priority Stack, Context Budget Mental Model, On/Off-Budget Computation. Max applied yesterday's evidence quality standards to today's claims - caught flawed token comparison reasoning, demanded empirical verification. Consistent methodology: skeptical inquiry → rigorous evidence → stronger conclusions.

**Keywords:** Claude Code, MCP, context windows, token optimization, prompt caching, token economics, cost analysis, @-mentions, MCP server toggling, empirical verification, skeptical inquiry, evidence quality, three-layer architecture, context budget, auto-compact, lazy toggle approach, output tokens, custom agents, Task tool, off-budget computation, thinking mode, output styles, Cost Optimization Priority Stack, Context Budget Mental Model, On/Off-Budget Computation, methodology application, CLAUDE.md externalization, project .mcp.json, ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL, Max's questioning style, trust through rigor, tutorial potential

**Topics:** Claude Code internals, context window optimization, token economics, cost analysis, MCP architecture, AI-assisted development, performance analysis, optimization strategy, evidence-based reasoning, system design, mental models, teaching and education

**Key Decisions:**
- Use lazy toggle approach for MCP management (disable only when hitting 70%+ context)
- Optimize output tokens before system prompt (5x cost leverage vs 0.1x)
- Keep lightweight MCP servers always on (context7, ide)
- Toggle heavy servers on-demand (supabase, chrome-devtools, notionApi)
- Don't optimize prematurely at current 58k/200k (29%) usage
- Focus cost reduction on response length, not cache reads
- Consider moving project-specific MCP to .mcp.json

**Key Insights:**
- Context windows use prompt caching, not accumulation (90% cost reduction after first turn)
- Output tokens are 80%+ of cost ($15/1M vs $3/1M input, $0.30/1M cache reads)
- @-mention MCP toggle exists for context management (long sessions), not cost/performance
- Custom agents are "off-budget" via Task tool (separate 200k context)
- MCP toggle verified empirically: 32.4k → 17.5k tokens (15k saved)
- System prompt reconstructed each turn, cached for efficiency
- Optimization priority: output length > tool results > message history > system prompt

**Unresolved:**
- Should Max externalize parts of CLAUDE.md to reduce always-on memory?
- Should Max move project-specific MCP servers to .mcp.json?
- Is thinking mode currently enabled, and should it be?
- Which specific long-term MCP management strategy will Max implement?

**Frameworks Developed:**
- Three-Layer Context Architecture (System/Messages/Cache)
- Cost Optimization Priority Stack (4 tiers by ROI)
- Context Budget Mental Model (fixed/variable/reserve)
- On-Budget vs Off-Budget Computation (direct vs delegated)

## 2025-10-10: MCP Context Management Research - A Case Study in Research Methodology

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-10-mcp-research-and-methodology-lessons.md](sessions/2025-10-10-mcp-research-and-methodology-lessons.md)

**Summary:** Max tested /fetch-session system successfully, then researched MCP context management (49.4k tokens, 24.7% of window). Initial research presented GitHub Issue #7296 claiming Task tool sub-agents don't inherit MCPs as "confirmed bug." Built extensive conclusions including "two sub-agent systems" framework. Max pushed back demanding evidence quality assessment: issue had 0 followers, 0 comments, linked to issue where OP admitted "my fault." Second research pass revealed flawed methodology. Max pointed to empirical proof: /document command just worked using Task sub-agent with Notion MCP (44 tool uses, 113.1k tokens). Definitive proof: Task tool sub-agents DO inherit MCPs. The "bug" was single unvalidated report, likely user error. Real validated problems: MCP context consumption (Issues #7328, #6759 with 36 and 29 reactions), no official tool filtering, deny permissions don't reduce context. Developed research methodology standards: Evidence Quality Pyramid (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/DISCARD based on engagement and validation), Research Validation Hierarchy (empirical testing beats secondary research), Confidence Labeling System (CONFIRMED/LIKELY/POSSIBLE/UNCONFIRMED). Main lesson: grade evidence quality before building conclusions, test claims when possible, present uncertainty explicitly. Session becomes case study in research failure → skeptical inquiry → correction → methodology improvement. Max chose to document mistakes transparently rather than hide them. Trust damaged but recovery path clear: apply quality standards consistently.

**Keywords:** MCP, research methodology, evidence quality, GitHub issues, Issue #7296, Issue #7328, Issue #6759, empirical testing, skeptical inquiry, engagement metrics, red flags, confidence calibration, Task tool, MCP inheritance, context window, Chrome DevTools, Notion API, Supabase, tool filtering, deny permissions, project .mcp.json, tool-filter-mcp proxy, flawed research, correction process, trust recovery, Evidence Quality Pyramid, Research Validation Hierarchy, Confidence Labeling System, /fetch-session, /document command, false conclusions, teaching artifact, learning from mistakes, Max's skepticism, single unvalidated source, empirical proof, test before building, validated findings

**Topics:** Research methodology, evidence assessment, quality control, MCP architecture, context window optimization, empirical validation, skeptical inquiry, trust and accountability, learning from failures, methodology standards

**Key Decisions:**
- Demand evidence quality assessment before accepting research
- Test empirically when claims are testable
- Present uncertainty explicitly with confidence labels
- Develop Evidence Quality Pyramid and validation hierarchy
- Document failures transparently as learning artifacts
- Apply systematic research standards going forward

**Key Validations:**
- /fetch-session system works perfectly (Phase 1)
- /document proves Task tool sub-agents inherit MCPs (44 tool uses, 113.1k tokens)
- Issues #7328 and #6759 are credible (high engagement, multiple reporters)
- Issue #7296 is not credible (0 followers, 0 comments, linked to OP error)
- tool-filter-mcp proxy exists as community solution
- Project .mcp.json works for excluding servers

**What Was Wrong:**
- Task tool MCP inheritance "bug" (single unvalidated report)
- "Two sub-agent systems" framework (built on false premise)
- Custom agents workaround (unnecessary, Task tool works fine)
- Extensive conclusions from low-quality source

**What Is Real:**
- MCP context consumption problem (49.4k tokens)
- No official tool-level filtering (Issues #7328, #6759 validated)
- All-or-nothing server loading
- deny permissions don't reduce context
- Task tool sub-agents DO inherit MCPs (empirically proven)

**Unresolved:**
- Which MCP strategy will Max implement? (project .mcp.json vs tool-filter-mcp vs hybrid)
- How to ensure research quality standards are consistently applied
- Whether trust can be fully rebuilt through consistent application of methodology

## 2025-10-09: Second Brain System Design

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-09-second-brain-system-design.md](sessions/2025-10-09-second-brain-system-design.md)

**Summary:** Max wanted to preserve valuable AI conversation reasoning for future sessions. Led to designing complete "second brain" conversational memory system. Two fundamental operations identified: RECORD (record sessions) and FETCH (retrieve context). RECORD must be done by main agent (needs full conversation context). FETCH should be delegated to sub-agent via Task tool (fresh context window, more reliable, keeps main conversation clean). Split PROTOCOL.md (RECORD instructions) and RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md (FETCH instructions) to match separate operations. Designed SESSION_LOG.md as lightweight discovery layer - scan summaries/keywords first, then read only relevant full sessions (prevents token waste). Created slash commands: /record-session and /fetch-session. Key insight: main agent should expand user's brief fetch request using conversation context before passing to sub-agent (sub-agent has zero context). Minimized slash command content - just point to source of truth files, don't duplicate instructions. Discovered slash commands run in main agent context (not separate sub-agents) but should often invoke sub-agents for complex work. Very meta session - designed system for recording conversations, then used it to record the design conversation itself.

**Topics:** Knowledge management, AI-assisted development, system architecture, documentation design, workflow optimization, meta-cognition

**Key Decisions:**
- Build conversational memory system (preserve reasoning, not just decisions)
- Two operations architecture (RECORD and FETCH)
- RECORD by main agent, FETCH by sub-agent
- Split PROTOCOL.md and RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md
- Use slash commands for deterministic invocation
- Main agent expands user's brief input for retrieval
- Minimize duplication, maximize source of truth

**Unresolved:** None - system complete

## 2025-10-08: Backlog Model Rethinking & Team Alignment

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-08-backlog-model-rethinking.md](sessions/2025-10-08-backlog-model-rethinking.md)

**Summary:** Max had initial insight that backlogs should represent contexts or projects rather than 1-to-1 person relationships. Through conversation with Claude, developed comprehensive arguments for context-centric "spaces" model. Explored why tags don't solve this problem - distinction between structural (backlogs define who sees what together) versus metadata (tags enable filtering and organization). Crafted message to co-founders Kevin and Michelle addressing anticipated "isn't this just Jira?" concern. Key arguments developed: cognitive load (structure in tool reduces structure in head), bilateral benefit (recipients who aren't users also get contextual visibility), magic links prove backlogs must be real entities (not just filtered views). Analyzed team meeting transcript where initial confusion about terminology versus concept resolved - everyone aligned on idea that multiple people can be in same backlog, same person can be in multiple backlogs. Decided to rename "backlog" to "space" based on Michelle's preference. Unresolved: exact MVP scope for multi-person spaces.

**Keywords:** backlog, spaces, context-centric, person-centric, backlogs versus tags, structural versus metadata, data model, magic links, nudging, multi-person collaboration, multiple participants, cognitive load, bilateral benefit, recipient visibility, Jira comparison, Asana, Trello, project management tools, team alignment, Michelle, Kevin, property search example, sisters, Unicorn backlog, terminology, naming, person-centric view, backlog-centric view, contact view, aggregation, filtering, shared workspace, shared visibility, collective accountability, informal contexts, casual collaboration, family, friends, zero friction, no account needed, promise-centric, interpersonal commitment, deliverable tracking, nudge workflow, WhatsApp message, co-founder communication, confusion resolution, mental models, frameworks, decision reasoning

**Topics:** Product architecture, data modeling, team communication, UX design, product strategy, terminology, value proposition

**Key Decisions:**
- Use context-centric "spaces" instead of person-centric backlogs
- Rename "backlog" to "space"
- Backlogs/spaces should support multiple participants
- Same person can be in multiple spaces
- Person-centric view (contact view) aggregates across all spaces involving that person
- Need dedicated backlog-centric view (not synonymous with contact view)

**Unresolved:**
- Exact MVP scope (does multi-person ship in v1 or Phase 2?)
- Final confirmation on "space" terminology from full team
- UI design for backlog-centric view (Michelle working on it)

**Artifacts:**
- [backlog-model-rethinking.md](../artifacts/backlog-model-rethinking.md) - Comprehensive conceptual report
- [message-to-cofounders.txt](../artifacts/message-to-cofounders.txt) - WhatsApp message explaining proposal
- [Discussing-Backlog.txt](../artifacts/Discussing-Backlog.txt) - Team meeting transcript
