## 2025-10-14-III: Step 4 Incident Analysis and Documentation Improvement

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-14-III-step4-incident-documentation-improvement.md](sessions/2025-10-14-III-step4-incident-documentation-improvement.md)

**Summary:** Step 4 implementation failed due to outdated extraction document - implemented wrong colors (gray instead of purple), wrong modes (Grid/Chat instead of List/Nudges), and missing components. User requested ultrathink analysis. Agent used Figma MCP tools to discover extraction doc (COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md) had drifted from actual Figma designs as they evolved. Created comprehensive 899-line incident report (kept local only) analyzing root causes, developed 6 hypotheses for why extraction was outdated, identified systemic documentation drift problem. Initially over-corrected with excessive warnings and repetition (20+ ⚠️ symbols, instructions in 4 places, 21-item checklist). User pushed back on over-emphasis. Subagent assessment revealed bloat defeated purpose - "when everything is critical, nothing is critical." Streamlined to single authoritative Figma Verification Protocol section, simplified checklist (21→11 items), reduced Step 4 guidance (53→15 lines), removed 80% of warnings while preserving essential information. Key insight: test documentation quality with minimal handoff prompt - if agent needs detailed explanation, documentation hasn't solved problem. Final handoff: 3-line prompt trusting improved docs. Decision to keep INCIDENT_REPORT local (too large for remote, valuable reference). Committed streamlined workflow improvements. Next agent will validate if documentation sufficient.

**Keywords:** Step 4 incident, documentation drift, extraction document outdated, Figma MCP tools, verification protocol, over-emphasis backfire, warning fatigue, subagent assessment, documentation quality testing, minimal handoff prompt, incident report, root cause analysis, wrong colors purple vs gray, wrong modes List/Nudges vs Grid/Chat, missing components, COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md, PHASE2_PLAN.md, PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md, visual comparison testing, color picker verification, Trust But Verify workflow, Documentation Emphasis Spectrum, streamlined from bloat, 899-line analysis kept local, systemic issues, source of truth vs reference, design evolution

**Topics:** Incident analysis, documentation quality, workflow improvement, over-correction pitfalls, verification protocols, agent reliability, documentation drift

**Key Decisions:**
- Add mandatory Figma Verification Protocol (before and after implementation)
- Keep INCIDENT_REPORT_STEP4.md local only (too large for remote)
- Use minimal handoff prompt to test if documentation improvements work
- Single authoritative protocol section instead of scattered instructions
- Instructional tone instead of panic tone

**Key Frameworks:**
- Documentation Emphasis Spectrum (too brief → just right → too verbose)
- Trust But Verify Workflow (Reference → Source of Truth → Implementation → Verification)
- Subagent for Unbiased Assessment (fresh context catches what author misses)

**Unresolved:**
- Will improved documentation be sufficient for next agent? (minimal prompt test)
- Should extraction documents be used at all vs. Figma MCP directly?

## 2025-10-14-II: Phase 2 Step 3 Completion & Documentation Workflow Requirements

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-14-II-phase2-step3-completion-documentation-workflow.md](sessions/2025-10-14-II-phase2-step3-completion-documentation-workflow.md)

**Summary:** Agent successfully executed Phase 2 Step 3 (ListCard molecule component) following established workflow: created feature branch, implemented both Contact and Space types in single component using TypeScript discriminated unions (architectural decision for maintainability), added comprehensive demo with review notes, ran automated testing protocol with Chrome DevTools MCP (desktop + mobile screenshots, console clean), created PR #7. User pointed out missing documentation updates - agent had updated PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md after being reminded, but this revealed workflow gap. User requested: "Make this instruction clearer so future agents will complete that without me having to tell them to." Agent added documentation updates as mandatory Critical Workflow Rule #4, positioned BEFORE reporting completion (step 5, not step 6), updated pre-flight checklist and TodoWrite templates, added to example completion reports. Key insight: successful workflow requirements (feature branches, testing) share pattern - mentioned in Critical Workflow Rules, checklist, TodoWrite examples, and step instructions. Documentation lacked this multi-layered reinforcement. Fix applied at all strategic checkpoints. ListCard implementation: both types in single component (90% shared structure), discriminated unions for type safety, reuses Avatar and EntryChip atomic components, matches Figma specs exactly, tested desktop (1440×900) and mobile (375×667). PR #7 ready with 3 commits including documentation workflow improvements.

**Keywords:** Phase 2 Step 3, ListCard component, molecule components, Contact type, Space type, TypeScript discriminated unions, component architecture, documentation workflow, mandatory requirements, Critical Workflow Rule #4, multi-layered enforcement, strategic checkpoints, PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md updates, PHASE2_PLAN.md reordering, update before reporting, feature branch workflow, automated testing, Chrome DevTools MCP, demo page, review notes for Michelle, PR #7, workflow gap identification, user feedback loop, discriminated union pattern, code maintainability, single update point, 90% shared structure, Avatar reuse, EntryChip reuse, Figma spec compliance, desktop testing, mobile testing, three commits

**Topics:** Phase 2 implementation, component development, workflow enforcement, documentation requirements, architectural patterns, TypeScript patterns, testing protocols

**Key Decisions:**
- Documentation update is now Critical Workflow Rule #4 (same prominence as feature branches and testing)
- Positioned as step 5 BEFORE step 6 "Report Completion" (makes it mandatory gate)
- Added to pre-flight checklist, TodoWrite examples, step instructions, example reports (multi-layered reinforcement)
- Both ListCard types in single component using discriminated unions (maintainability over separation)

**Key Frameworks:**
- Multi-Layered Workflow Enforcement (mention requirement at multiple strategic checkpoints, not just once)
- Positioning as Enforcement Mechanism (order matters - update before report makes it mandatory)
- Discriminated Unions for Component Variants (when variants share 90%+ structure, differ in single section)

**Unresolved:**
- Will documentation workflow requirements prevent future forgetting? (test with Step 4 agent)

## 2025-10-14: Phase 2 Workflow Documentation Improvements

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-14-phase2-workflow-documentation-improvements.md](sessions/2025-10-14-phase2-workflow-documentation-improvements.md)

**Summary:** Agent violated Phase 2 workflow by committing to main, skipping testing, not stopping for review. Max requested documentation improvements to prevent future violations. Conducted three rounds of improvements based on independent subagent analyses. First round fixed critical issues: entry point confusion (made PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md definitive entry point, removed circular references), testing timing ambiguity (explicit "test after both commits complete"), context loss mitigation (added TodoWrite guidance, CHECKPOINT sections, reminders at start/middle/end of step), violation consequences. Second round verified fixes effective (85-90% estimated success rate) with fresh subagent review. Third round reduced verbosity while preserving critical information (87 lines cut, 6.5% reduction). Key insight: problem isn't lack of instructions - it's context loss during long execution (6-8 hours, hundreds of tool calls). Solution: strategic redundancy at critical checkpoints, not just initial instructions. Removed "wait for user approval" language (Chrome DevTools MCP enables self-verification). Created PR #6 with comprehensive improvements. Simplified universal prompt: "Continue Phase 2 work. Start by reading PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md." Documentation now self-explanatory - no complex prompts needed.

**Keywords:** workflow violations, documentation improvements, agent behavior, context loss mitigation, Phase 2, feature branch workflow, automated testing, Chrome DevTools MCP, TodoWrite integration, CHECKPOINT sections, entry point clarity, testing timing, strategic redundancy, verbosity reduction, subagent analysis, independent verification, PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md, PHASE2_PLAN.md, self-explanatory documentation, simple universal prompt, PR #6, three-round refinement, multi-agent review, effectiveness verification, 85-90% success rate, rollback and restart, workflow protocol

**Topics:** Documentation design, workflow enforcement, agent behavior, quality control, context management, testing protocols, multi-agent collaboration, iterative refinement

**Key Decisions:**
- PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md is definitive entry point (no circular references)
- Test after both commits complete (not after each)
- Removed "wait for user approval" (Chrome DevTools MCP enables self-verification)
- Conservative verbosity cuts (87 lines, 6.5%) to preserve context loss mitigation
- Simple universal prompt: "Continue Phase 2 work. Start by reading PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md."

**Key Frameworks:**
- Context Loss During Long-Running Tasks (6-8 hour sessions cause forgetting)
- Strategic Redundancy vs. Information Overload (repeat at checkpoints, condense verbose explanations)
- Documentation Self-Explanation Test (simple prompt = good documentation)

**Unresolved:**
- Will simplified documentation prevent violations? (needs testing with next agent)
- Is 6.5% verbosity reduction enough?

## 2025-10-13-III: Demo Page UX Improvements & Designer Review Notes System

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-13-III-demo-page-ux-improvements-and-designer-review-notes.md](sessions/2025-10-13-III-demo-page-ux-improvements-and-designer-review-notes.md)

**Summary:** After completing Phase 2 Step 2 (Avatar and EntryChip components), Max identified critical workflow gaps: agent jumped to Step 3 without testing Step 2, no feature branch used, demo page had UX issues (duplicate Entry Chips with inconsistent sizes, too dense, poor organization), and testing was too narrow (technical correctness but missed UX consistency). Implemented comprehensive fixes: added mandatory Agent Execution Protocol to PHASE2_PLAN.md (feature branches required, stop after each step, automated testing with Chrome DevTools MCP, visual consistency review), rewrote demo page with collapsible sections by step for better scalability, removed duplication (Step 1 shows color swatches, Step 2 shows functional components), added designer review notes embedded in demo page so Michelle can review from Vercel preview without navigating GitHub PRs. Max questioned why demo notes were shorter than PR description notes - led to two-tier solution: scannable main section (2-3 min quick verification) + collapsible detailed section (10-15 min comprehensive review with exact hex codes, edge cases, usage context). Progressive disclosure principle: Michelle controls level of detail, no information omitted but no information overload. Properly reverted commits and created feature branch `feature/phase2-step-2-atomic-components` with cherry-picked commits, pushed PR #5. Key lesson: as context grows (~140k tokens), vigilance required to avoid basic mistakes like skipping protocols or missing UX issues that should be obvious.

**Keywords:** demo page UX, collapsible sections, designer review notes, Michelle collaboration, progressive disclosure, two-tier structure, feature branch workflow, Agent Execution Protocol, testing improvements, visual consistency, Chrome DevTools MCP, automated testing, UX quality vs technical correctness, information architecture, Vercel preview, PR navigation, embedded documentation, context size impact, workflow gaps, Step 2 completion, Avatar component, EntryChip component, PHASE2_PLAN.md updates, designer-developer workflow, scannable checklists, detailed verification, hex codes, edge cases, usage context, PR #5

**Topics:** UX design, designer collaboration, workflow improvements, testing methodology, documentation architecture, progressive disclosure, information design

**Key Decisions:**
- Feature branch mandatory for each Phase 2 step (documented in PHASE2_PLAN.md)
- Agent must stop after each step for testing/approval (no automatic continuation)
- Demo page uses collapsible sections by step for scalability
- Designer review notes embedded in demo page (two-tier structure)
- Two-tier review notes: scannable main + collapsible detailed (progressive disclosure)

**Key Frameworks:**
- Progressive Disclosure Pattern (quick scan vs deep dive, user controls depth)
- Two Contexts for Same Information (PR vs Demo have different information needs)
- Testing Levels: Technical Correctness → Component Quality → UX Consistency → Information Architecture

**Unresolved:** None - all issues identified and fixed

## 2025-10-13-II: Phase 2 Foundation Completion & Agent Handoff System

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-13-II-phase2-foundation-completion-and-agent-handoff-system.md](sessions/2025-10-13-II-phase2-foundation-completion-and-agent-handoff-system.md)

**Summary:** Continued Phase 2 Step 1 after previous agent left Tailwind v4 upgrade incomplete at context limit. Completed upgrade, verified all design tokens against Figma extraction. Discovered critical handoff problem: plan said "Step 1 Pending" while git showed 8/8 commits complete. Created comprehensive two-file agent handoff system separating status tracking (PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md) from methodology (PHASE2_PLAN.md). Key insight: status changes frequently, methodology rarely - mixing them creates contradictions and staleness. Removed all hardcoded specs from plan (duplication defeats single source of truth), changed brittle line number references to resilient section names. Launched subagent with fresh eyes to review plan - achieved 73% reduction (856→225 lines) while keeping 100% essential content for future work. Removed 500+ lines of outdated Step 1 details (described Tailwind v3, we used v4), eliminated 100+ lines of duplicated workflow explanations. Cleaned up 6 temporary files (2,096 lines) before PR: post-mortems, verification notes, copy-pasted docs - knowledge incorporated into permanent documentation. Created comprehensive PR #4 with complete Step 1 foundation and validated handoff system ready for incoming agents.

**Keywords:** agent handoff, multi-agent collaboration, status tracking, Tailwind CSS v4, design tokens verification, PHASE2_STATUS_TRACKING.md, PHASE2_PLAN.md refactoring, documentation maintenance, single source of truth, section references, subagent review, fresh eyes pattern, duplication elimination, temporary file cleanup, PR hygiene, two-file system, separation of concerns, brittle references, resilient architecture, Extract-Reference-Build-Verify workflow, incoming agent orientation, context limit handoff, git verification, Figma MCP validation, Step 1 completion, comprehensive PR

**Topics:** Agent collaboration systems, documentation architecture, project handoff, methodology design, quality standards

**Key Decisions:**
- Two-file system: STATUS (what's done) separate from PLAN (how to work)
- Section names not line numbers for references (resilient vs brittle)
- No hardcoded specs in plan - only reference extraction document
- Remove temporary files before PR (incorporate knowledge, remove clutter)
- Subagent review for fresh perspective after intensive editing

**Key Frameworks:**
- Two-File Pattern for Multi-Agent Work (STATUS + PLAN separation)
- Extract → Reference → Build → Verify workflow
- Fresh Eyes Subagent Review Pattern (when/how to delegate)

## 2025-10-13: Design Integration Planning - Phase 2 Mobile MVP

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-13-design-integration-planning-phase2-mobile-mvp.md](sessions/2025-10-13-design-integration-planning-phase2-mobile-mvp.md)

**Summary:** Max preparing to start Phase 2 (mobile-first MVP) with co-founder Michelle's designs - first time working with UX/UI designer. Created comprehensive 370+ line DESIGN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md covering design tokens, Figma basics, component architecture, and collaboration best practices. Inspected Michelle's Figma designs using MCP tools - discovered component library ready but design tokens not formally created (must extract manually). Michelle's October 12th notes revealed what's ready (List View, components) vs. uncertain (Grid/Chat views). Established strategic approaches: 90/10 mobile-first priority (90% mobile perfection, 10% desktop basic), branch-per-step git workflow for incremental feedback, mock data first then Supabase integration, simplified interactions (modals not sliding drawers). Created CHANGE Protocol for handling evolving requirements - 5-step process with prioritization matrix and communication format. Developed AGENT_PROMPT_DESIGN_INTEGRATION.md through 3 iterations to be self-contained. Agent proposed plan, received feedback twice, final plan approved with Tailwind CSS, 40-50 hour timeline, detailed Step 1-2 breakdowns (8 commits + 4 commits). Step 1 completed (foundation: Tailwind, tokens, mock data, demo page, archive v0), Max caught that testing wasn't prompted - established protocol that verification required after each step before marking complete. Key frameworks: 90/10 Rule, CHANGE Protocol, Branch-Per-Step, Design Intent Translation, Mock-Then-Real decoupling. Terminology decision: "space" not "backlog" in all new code. Four major artifacts created: educational guide, agent prompt, plan feedback documents, final implementation plan.

**Keywords:** design integration, Figma, mobile-first MVP, UX/UI designer collaboration, design tokens, component architecture, Tailwind CSS, branch-per-step workflow, CHANGE Protocol, 90/10 Rule, mock data strategy, incremental feedback, Michelle, design-to-code translation, atomic design, git workflow, testing protocol, evolving requirements, DESIGN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, AGENT_PROMPT_DESIGN_INTEGRATION.md, PHASE2_PLAN.md, space terminology, simplified interactions, startup constraints, Figma MCP server, Dev Mode, design intent, responsive design, feature branches, verification protocol

## 2025-10-11: Claude Code Context Management Deep Dive

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-11-claude-code-context-management-deep-dive.md](sessions/2025-10-11-claude-code-context-management-deep-dive.md)

**Summary:** Max asked for explanation of latest Claude Code release notes focusing on MCP features. Evolved into comprehensive education on context window mechanics, token economics, and optimization strategies. Started with MCP release history (v0.2.31 through v2.0.14), explained @-mentions evolution (files → folders → MCP resources → agents → MCP servers). Max skeptical whether @-mention toggle actually works - demanded evidence. Empirically verified: MCP tools dropped from 32.4k to 17.5k tokens (15k saved) by toggling off supabase and chrome-devtools. Deep dive into how context windows actually work: traditional accumulation model vs Claude Code's prompt caching. System prompt sent once and cached (5 min TTL), subsequent turns pay ~10% cache read cost ($0.30/1M vs $3/1M write). Context has three layers: System (cached static), Messages (growing dynamic), Cache (invisible infrastructure). Explored all tool types: System tools (11.9k, always on), MCP tools (variable, toggleable), Custom agents (minimal, off-budget via Task tool), Slash commands (~1k), Memory files (1.7k). Calculated actual costs: 20-turn conversation with full MCP costs ~$0.21, with reduced MCP ~$0.15, savings $0.06. Key insight: output tokens are 80%+ of cost ($15/1M) - typical response $0.03, cache read $0.0009. Optimization priority stack: (1) output length 5x leverage, (2) tool result size 3x, (3) message history 2x, (4) system prompt 0.1x. Conclusion: at 58k/200k (29%) usage, optimization is premature. Use lazy toggle approach - only disable MCP when hitting 70%+ context. MCP toggle exists for context management in long sessions (100+ turns), not cost/performance. Custom agents are "off-budget" - separate 200k context via Task tool, only summary returns to main. Developed four frameworks: Three-Layer Context Architecture, Cost Optimization Priority Stack, Context Budget Mental Model, On/Off-Budget Computation. Max applied yesterday's evidence quality standards to today's claims - caught flawed token comparison reasoning, demanded empirical verification. Consistent methodology: skeptical inquiry → rigorous evidence → stronger conclusions.

**Keywords:** Claude Code, MCP, context windows, token optimization, prompt caching, token economics, cost analysis, @-mentions, MCP server toggling, empirical verification, skeptical inquiry, evidence quality, three-layer architecture, context budget, auto-compact, lazy toggle approach, output tokens, custom agents, Task tool, off-budget computation, thinking mode, output styles, Cost Optimization Priority Stack, Context Budget Mental Model, On/Off-Budget Computation, methodology application, CLAUDE.md externalization, project .mcp.json, ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL, Max's questioning style, trust through rigor, tutorial potential

**Topics:** Claude Code internals, context window optimization, token economics, cost analysis, MCP architecture, AI-assisted development, performance analysis, optimization strategy, evidence-based reasoning, system design, mental models, teaching and education

**Key Decisions:**
- Use lazy toggle approach for MCP management (disable only when hitting 70%+ context)
- Optimize output tokens before system prompt (5x cost leverage vs 0.1x)
- Keep lightweight MCP servers always on (context7, ide)
- Toggle heavy servers on-demand (supabase, chrome-devtools, notionApi)
- Don't optimize prematurely at current 58k/200k (29%) usage
- Focus cost reduction on response length, not cache reads
- Consider moving project-specific MCP to .mcp.json

**Key Insights:**
- Context windows use prompt caching, not accumulation (90% cost reduction after first turn)
- Output tokens are 80%+ of cost ($15/1M vs $3/1M input, $0.30/1M cache reads)
- @-mention MCP toggle exists for context management (long sessions), not cost/performance
- Custom agents are "off-budget" via Task tool (separate 200k context)
- MCP toggle verified empirically: 32.4k → 17.5k tokens (15k saved)
- System prompt reconstructed each turn, cached for efficiency
- Optimization priority: output length > tool results > message history > system prompt

**Unresolved:**
- Should Max externalize parts of CLAUDE.md to reduce always-on memory?
- Should Max move project-specific MCP servers to .mcp.json?
- Is thinking mode currently enabled, and should it be?
- Which specific long-term MCP management strategy will Max implement?

**Frameworks Developed:**
- Three-Layer Context Architecture (System/Messages/Cache)
- Cost Optimization Priority Stack (4 tiers by ROI)
- Context Budget Mental Model (fixed/variable/reserve)
- On-Budget vs Off-Budget Computation (direct vs delegated)

## 2025-10-10: MCP Context Management Research - A Case Study in Research Methodology

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-10-mcp-research-and-methodology-lessons.md](sessions/2025-10-10-mcp-research-and-methodology-lessons.md)

**Summary:** Max tested /fetch-session system successfully, then researched MCP context management (49.4k tokens, 24.7% of window). Initial research presented GitHub Issue #7296 claiming Task tool sub-agents don't inherit MCPs as "confirmed bug." Built extensive conclusions including "two sub-agent systems" framework. Max pushed back demanding evidence quality assessment: issue had 0 followers, 0 comments, linked to issue where OP admitted "my fault." Second research pass revealed flawed methodology. Max pointed to empirical proof: /document command just worked using Task sub-agent with Notion MCP (44 tool uses, 113.1k tokens). Definitive proof: Task tool sub-agents DO inherit MCPs. The "bug" was single unvalidated report, likely user error. Real validated problems: MCP context consumption (Issues #7328, #6759 with 36 and 29 reactions), no official tool filtering, deny permissions don't reduce context. Developed research methodology standards: Evidence Quality Pyramid (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/DISCARD based on engagement and validation), Research Validation Hierarchy (empirical testing beats secondary research), Confidence Labeling System (CONFIRMED/LIKELY/POSSIBLE/UNCONFIRMED). Main lesson: grade evidence quality before building conclusions, test claims when possible, present uncertainty explicitly. Session becomes case study in research failure → skeptical inquiry → correction → methodology improvement. Max chose to document mistakes transparently rather than hide them. Trust damaged but recovery path clear: apply quality standards consistently.

**Keywords:** MCP, research methodology, evidence quality, GitHub issues, Issue #7296, Issue #7328, Issue #6759, empirical testing, skeptical inquiry, engagement metrics, red flags, confidence calibration, Task tool, MCP inheritance, context window, Chrome DevTools, Notion API, Supabase, tool filtering, deny permissions, project .mcp.json, tool-filter-mcp proxy, flawed research, correction process, trust recovery, Evidence Quality Pyramid, Research Validation Hierarchy, Confidence Labeling System, /fetch-session, /document command, false conclusions, teaching artifact, learning from mistakes, Max's skepticism, single unvalidated source, empirical proof, test before building, validated findings

**Topics:** Research methodology, evidence assessment, quality control, MCP architecture, context window optimization, empirical validation, skeptical inquiry, trust and accountability, learning from failures, methodology standards

**Key Decisions:**
- Demand evidence quality assessment before accepting research
- Test empirically when claims are testable
- Present uncertainty explicitly with confidence labels
- Develop Evidence Quality Pyramid and validation hierarchy
- Document failures transparently as learning artifacts
- Apply systematic research standards going forward

**Key Validations:**
- /fetch-session system works perfectly (Phase 1)
- /document proves Task tool sub-agents inherit MCPs (44 tool uses, 113.1k tokens)
- Issues #7328 and #6759 are credible (high engagement, multiple reporters)
- Issue #7296 is not credible (0 followers, 0 comments, linked to OP error)
- tool-filter-mcp proxy exists as community solution
- Project .mcp.json works for excluding servers

**What Was Wrong:**
- Task tool MCP inheritance "bug" (single unvalidated report)
- "Two sub-agent systems" framework (built on false premise)
- Custom agents workaround (unnecessary, Task tool works fine)
- Extensive conclusions from low-quality source

**What Is Real:**
- MCP context consumption problem (49.4k tokens)
- No official tool-level filtering (Issues #7328, #6759 validated)
- All-or-nothing server loading
- deny permissions don't reduce context
- Task tool sub-agents DO inherit MCPs (empirically proven)

**Unresolved:**
- Which MCP strategy will Max implement? (project .mcp.json vs tool-filter-mcp vs hybrid)
- How to ensure research quality standards are consistently applied
- Whether trust can be fully rebuilt through consistent application of methodology

## 2025-10-09: Second Brain System Design

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-09-second-brain-system-design.md](sessions/2025-10-09-second-brain-system-design.md)

**Summary:** Max wanted to preserve valuable AI conversation reasoning for future sessions. Led to designing complete "second brain" conversational memory system. Two fundamental operations identified: RECORD (record sessions) and FETCH (retrieve context). RECORD must be done by main agent (needs full conversation context). FETCH should be delegated to sub-agent via Task tool (fresh context window, more reliable, keeps main conversation clean). Split PROTOCOL.md (RECORD instructions) and RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md (FETCH instructions) to match separate operations. Designed SESSION_LOG.md as lightweight discovery layer - scan summaries/keywords first, then read only relevant full sessions (prevents token waste). Created slash commands: /record-session and /fetch-session. Key insight: main agent should expand user's brief fetch request using conversation context before passing to sub-agent (sub-agent has zero context). Minimized slash command content - just point to source of truth files, don't duplicate instructions. Discovered slash commands run in main agent context (not separate sub-agents) but should often invoke sub-agents for complex work. Very meta session - designed system for recording conversations, then used it to record the design conversation itself.

**Keywords:** second brain, conversational memory, knowledge management, session recording, session retrieval, context preservation, AI workflows, system design, architecture, two operations, RECORD operation, FETCH operation, PROTOCOL.md, RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md, SESSION_LOG.md, slash commands, /record-session, /fetch-session, sub-agents, Task tool, general-purpose agent, context window, token management, lightweight index, discovery layer, source of truth pattern, deterministic invocation, expansion pattern, reasoning over conclusions, thought processes, mental models, cognitive load, documentation system, meta, ADR, Architecture Decision Records, CLAUDE.md, delegation, fresh context, compressed summary, keywords, discoverability, duplication avoidance, maintenance, systems thinking, explicit invocation, Claude Code, commands vs sub-agents, article learning, /document command, context pollution, minimal prompts, comprehensive instructions, bilateral architecture

**Topics:** Knowledge management, AI-assisted development, system architecture, documentation design, workflow optimization, meta-cognition

**Key Decisions:**
- Build conversational memory system (preserve reasoning, not just decisions)
- Two operations architecture (RECORD and FETCH)
- RECORD by main agent, FETCH by sub-agent
- Split PROTOCOL.md and RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md
- Use slash commands for deterministic invocation
- Main agent expands user's brief input for retrieval
- Minimize duplication, maximize source of truth

**Unresolved:** None - system complete

**Artifacts:**
- [PROTOCOL.md](../PROTOCOL.md)
- [RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md](../RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md)
- [commands/record-session.md](../../.claude/commands/record-session.md)
- [commands/fetch-session.md](../../.claude/commands/fetch-session.md)

## 2025-10-08: Backlog Model Rethinking & Team Alignment

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-08-backlog-model-rethinking.md](sessions/2025-10-08-backlog-model-rethinking.md)

**Summary:** Max had initial insight that backlogs should represent contexts or projects rather than 1-to-1 person relationships. Through conversation with Claude, developed comprehensive arguments for context-centric "spaces" model. Explored why tags don't solve this problem - distinction between structural (backlogs define who sees what together) versus metadata (tags enable filtering and organization). Crafted message to co-founders Kevin and Michelle addressing anticipated "isn't this just Jira?" concern. Key arguments developed: cognitive load (structure in tool reduces structure in head), bilateral benefit (recipients who aren't users also get contextual visibility), magic links prove backlogs must be real entities (not just filtered views). Analyzed team meeting transcript where initial confusion about terminology versus concept resolved - everyone aligned on idea that multiple people can be in same backlog, same person can be in multiple backlogs. Decided to rename "backlog" to "space" based on Michelle's preference. Unresolved: exact MVP scope for multi-person spaces.

**Keywords:** backlog, spaces, context-centric, person-centric, backlogs versus tags, structural versus metadata, data model, magic links, nudging, multi-person collaboration, multiple participants, cognitive load, bilateral benefit, recipient visibility, Jira comparison, Asana, Trello, project management tools, team alignment, Michelle, Kevin, property search example, sisters, Unicorn backlog, terminology, naming, person-centric view, backlog-centric view, contact view, aggregation, filtering, shared workspace, shared visibility, collective accountability, informal contexts, casual collaboration, family, friends, zero friction, no account needed, promise-centric, interpersonal commitment, deliverable tracking, nudge workflow, WhatsApp message, co-founder communication, confusion resolution, mental models, frameworks, decision reasoning

**Topics:** Product architecture, data modeling, team communication, UX design, product strategy, terminology, value proposition

**Key Decisions:**
- Use context-centric "spaces" instead of person-centric backlogs
- Rename "backlog" to "space"
- Backlogs/spaces should support multiple participants
- Same person can be in multiple spaces
- Person-centric view (contact view) aggregates across all spaces involving that person
- Need dedicated backlog-centric view (not synonymous with contact view)

**Unresolved:**
- Exact MVP scope (does multi-person ship in v1 or Phase 2?)
- Final confirmation on "space" terminology from full team
- UI design for backlog-centric view (Michelle working on it)

**Artifacts:**
- [backlog-model-rethinking.md](../artifacts/backlog-model-rethinking.md) - Comprehensive conceptual report
- [message-to-cofounders.txt](../artifacts/message-to-cofounders.txt) - WhatsApp message explaining proposal
- [Discussing-Backlog.txt](../artifacts/Discussing-Backlog.txt) - Team meeting transcript
