# Continue Phase 2 Mobile-First Implementation - Session Handoff

**Date Created:** 2025-10-13
**Branch:** `feature/phase2-foundation`
**Current Status:** Step 1 completion verification in progress after corrections

---

## Context: What Happened So Far

We're implementing Phase 2 of the WalkTheWalk MVP, which is rebuilding the frontend with Michelle's mobile-first Figma designs. The backend (Supabase, API routes, authentication) from Phase 1 stays unchanged - we're only rebuilding the UI.

### Session Summary

**Step 1 (Foundation Setup) was planned as 8 commits:**
1. ✅ Install Tailwind CSS
2. ✅ Extract color tokens from Figma
3. ✅ Document spacing scale
4. ✅ Configure typography tokens
5. ✅ Add visual effects tokens
6. ✅ Create mock data structure
7. ✅ Create component demo page
8. ✅ Archive v0 demo pages

**However, execution had critical failures:**

1. **Wrong Tailwind Version** - Initially installed v4 beta (experimental) instead of v3 stable, causing CSS not to apply
2. **Incomplete Figma Extraction** - Missed the purple "Entry Closed" status color entirely, used assumptions instead of extracting actual values
3. **No Built-In Verification** - Asked user to verify instead of systematically extracting exact values from Figma first

### What We Did to Fix It

**Created these key documents:**
- **COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md** - Systematic extraction of ALL 22 component variants from Michelle's Figma with exact values and node IDs
- **POST_MORTEM.md** - Comprehensive analysis of what went wrong, why, and process improvements for going forward
- **PHASE2_PLAN.md** - Original implementation plan (700+ lines, still valid structure but execution needs improvement)

**Fixed the code:**
- Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.0 (stable)
- Updated tailwind.config.js with ALL correct colors from Figma extraction
- Added missing purple status color (#843DFF / #E8DAFF)
- Added avatar colors, navigation colors, IBM Plex Mono font
- Demo page now shows all 5 status colors correctly

**Current git status:**
- 13 commits on feature/phase2-foundation
- All design tokens corrected
- Dev server runs successfully at http://localhost:3000

---

## Your Immediate Task

**User needs verification that Step 1 is now truly complete and correct.**

### What You Should Do First:

1. **Read these files in order:**
   - `POST_MORTEM.md` - Understand what went wrong and why
   - `COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md` - See the complete, correct extraction
   - `PHASE2_PLAN.md` - Understand the overall plan structure
   - `tailwind.config.js` - See the corrected design tokens

2. **Verify the corrections:**
   - Check if dev server is running (http://localhost:3000)
   - Navigate to /demo page
   - Verify all 5 Entry Chip colors render correctly:
     - No Nudge: transparent bg, black border
     - Nudge Scheduled: light yellow bg (#FFFCEF), yellow border (#FCD915)
     - Nudge Sent: light blue bg (#EAF6FF), blue border (#004CCE)
     - Nudge Responded: light green bg (#EAFFF4), green border (#00B017)
     - **Entry Closed: light purple bg (#E8DAFF), purple border (#843DFF)** ← This was missing before!

3. **Assess if Step 1 is truly complete:**
   - All design tokens match Figma extraction document?
   - Demo page works correctly?
   - Mock data structure in place?
   - Documentation accurate?

4. **Get user sign-off:**
   - Ask user to confirm colors now match Michelle's Figma
   - Ask if extraction document is complete
   - Get approval to proceed to Step 2 OR identify remaining issues

## Key Context About the Project

### Project Overview
- **Product:** WalkTheWalk - Accountability platform for tracking promises and sending nudges
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS v3
- **Design:** Michelle created mobile-first Figma designs (Components page is dev-ready)
- **Priority:** 90% mobile web (320-767px), 10% desktop "good enough"

### Figma File Details
- **File Key:** yDQ6JquKmyd2nrCUhp3nda
- **Components Page Node ID:** 177:32228
- **You have Figma MCP tools available** - Use them to extract exact values, don't guess!

### Important Terminology
- Use "**space**" not "backlog" in all new code (product terminology evolved)
- "Entry Chip" = status indicator (5 variants for promise/entry states)
- "Avatar" = 3 variants (image, contact-initials, space-initials)

## Critical Lessons from POST_MORTEM.md

**Read POST_MORTEM.md carefully!** Key takeaways:

### 1. Extraction-First Workflow
**Before ANY coding:**
- Use Figma MCP to extract ALL component variants
- Create extraction document
- User reviews and approves extraction
- THEN update design tokens from extraction document

### 2. No Assumptions Without Verification
**Don't assume:**
- "Error status = red" (it's actually purple!)
- "I extracted from Figma" (verify you actually did)
- "Colors probably match" (check exact hex values)

**Always verify:**
- Extract actual values from Figma using MCP tools
- Document exact hex codes with Figma node IDs
- Cross-reference every value against extraction document

### 3. Built-In Verification
**Every step must include:**
- What was built
- How it was verified
- What the acceptance criteria were
- Evidence it meets criteria

**User should review extraction data, not implementation details.**

### 4. Use Figma MCP Tools Proactively
**Available tools:**
- `mcp__figma__get_metadata` - See ALL components structure
- `mcp__figma__get_code` - Get exact values for each component
- `mcp__figma__get_screenshot` - Visual comparison

**Use them:**
- Systematically for EVERY component
- BEFORE coding, not when stuck
- To extract data, not to guess

## Process Improvements for Step 2+

Based on lessons learned, here's the improved workflow:

### Phase 1a: Extraction & Review
1. Review COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md with user
2. Confirm all components are documented
3. Identify any missing components or values
4. User signs off on extraction accuracy

### Phase 1b: Implementation
1. Build one component at a time
2. Use EXACT values from extraction document
3. Test in /demo after each component
4. Screenshot comparison: Figma vs. implementation
5. No assumptions - only documented data

### Phase 1c: Verification
1. After each component: visual comparison
2. If doesn't match: fix immediately, don't proceed
3. Commit only when verified correct
4. Acceptance criteria explicitly stated in commit message

## What Step 2 (Atomic Components) Will Involve

**Components to build (from PHASE2_PLAN.md Step 2):**

1. **Avatar Component** (2-2.5 hours)
   - 3 variants: image, contact-initials, space-initials
   - 3 sizes: sm (24px), md (44px), lg (64px)
   - All specs in COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md lines 150-239

2. **EntryChip Component** (2-2.5 hours)
   - 5 status variants (all documented in extraction)
   - 36px height, 2px border radius, 12px padding
   - Specs in COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md lines 9-147

3. **Button Component** (2-3 hours)
   - Primary, secondary, icon, add variants
   - Loading and disabled states
   - Need to verify extraction has all button variants

4. **StatusIndicator Component** (1.5-2 hours)
   - Online/recent/offline status dots
   - 8px circular indicators
   - With optional timestamp label

**Before starting Step 2, you MUST:**
- Get user confirmation that Step 1 is complete
- Review COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md together
- Confirm all needed component data is extracted
- Extract any missing component variants if needed

## User's Expectations

**From feedback, the user wants:**
1. **Systematic extraction** from Figma (not assumptions)
2. **Verification built-in** (don't ask user to verify basics)
3. **Exact color matching** (Michelle's designs are dev-ready)
4. **Testing at end of each step** (not optional, required)
5. **Process improvements** (learn from failures)

**User is collaborative but expects:**
- Proactive verification (you verify, user spot-checks)
- Accuracy over speed (get it right first time)
- Clear communication when uncertain
- Use of available tools (Figma MCP) effectively

---

## Current Open Questions

**These need to be resolved before proceeding to Step 2:**

1. **Are the corrected colors now accurate?**
   - User should verify demo page shows correct colors
   - Especially check purple "Entry Closed" is now visible

2. **Is COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md complete?**
   - Does it have ALL components needed for Step 2?
   - Button component variants - are they all documented?
   - Any missing components or states?

3. **Should we adjust PHASE2_PLAN.md based on lessons learned?**
   - Add extraction phase before each step?
   - More explicit verification criteria?
   - Break steps down differently?

4. **Is the user comfortable with the new extraction-first process?**
   - Do they understand the workflow?
   - Any concerns about the approach?
   - Ready to proceed with confidence?

## How to Start Your Conversation

**Suggested opening:**

"Hi! I'm continuing where the previous session left off. I've reviewed the context and understand we just completed corrections to Step 1 (Foundation Setup) after encountering issues with Tailwind version and incomplete Figma extraction.

I've read the POST_MORTEM.md and understand what went wrong and the process improvements we're implementing going forward.

**Before we proceed to Step 2, let me verify Step 1 is now complete:**

1. Let me check the dev server and demo page..."
[Check if server is running, test /demo page]

2. "I can see [description of what's rendered on /demo]. Can you confirm:
   - Do the 5 Entry Chip colors now match Michelle's Figma exactly?
   - Is the purple 'Entry Closed' status now visible?
   - Are there any remaining issues with the design tokens?"

3. "Once you confirm Step 1 is correct, I'd like to review COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md together to ensure we have all the data needed for Step 2 (building Avatar, EntryChip, Button, and StatusIndicator components)."

**Then proceed based on user's response.**

## Critical Reminders

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Make assumptions about colors or values
- ❌ Skip extraction and go straight to coding
- ❌ Ask user to verify things you should have verified
- ❌ Trust your interpretation over Figma source data
- ❌ Move fast and break things

**DO:**
- ✅ Extract exact values from Figma using MCP tools
- ✅ Create/update extraction documents before coding
- ✅ Verify systematically with screenshots and comparisons
- ✅ Use extraction document as single source of truth
- ✅ Get user sign-off on extraction, not implementation
- ✅ Measure twice, cut once

---

## Additional Context Files

**If you need more context, read these:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions and workflow guidance
- `PROJECT_SPEC.md` - Complete technical specification
- `DESIGN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Guide for working with UX/UI designers
- `src/styles/design-tokens.md` - Design system reference

**Figma-related files:**
- `COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md` - Your primary reference for ALL component values
- `AGENT_PROMPT_DESIGN_INTEGRATION.md` - Original prompt for design integration

---

## Success Criteria

**You'll know you're doing well when:**
1. User confirms colors match Figma without hesitation
2. Extraction document is used as source of truth (not guesses)
3. Verification happens proactively (not reactively when user finds issues)
4. Components match Figma pixel-perfect on first try
5. User trusts the process and your work

**You'll know there's a problem when:**
1. User has to point out color mismatches
2. You can't trace a value back to Figma extraction
3. You're asking "does this look right?" instead of "this matches extraction document section X"
4. Rework is needed because verification was skipped
5. User seems uncertain or needs to double-check basics

## Final Notes

**This session ended because:** Context limit approaching (150K+ tokens used)

**The user is:** Knowledgeable, collaborative, expects high quality work. They understand development and design. They caught the purple color issue - be thorough so they don't have to catch issues.

**Michelle (the designer):** Created dev-ready Figma designs. Her Components page is the source of truth. All values should come from there.

**The goal:** Build a mobile-first design system that matches Michelle's Figma designs pixel-perfect, using an extraction-first workflow with built-in verification.

**Your mission:** Help the user verify Step 1 is truly complete, then proceed to Step 2 using the improved extraction-first process documented in POST_MORTEM.md.
