## For Incoming Agents: How to Orient Yourself

**Step 1: Check this file first**
- Read "Current Status" section to see where we are
- Read the step marked "IN PROGRESS" or next "READY TO START"
- Check "Important Notes" for context

**Step 2: Verify against git**
```bash
# See what's actually been done
git log --oneline --grep="Phase 2" -30

# Check current branch
git branch

# See what's changed recently
git diff main --stat
```

**Step 3: Read relevant documentation**
- `PHASE2_PLAN.md` - Overall plan and methodology
- `COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md` - Design specs for components you're building
- `CONTINUE_SESSION.md` - Context from previous session (if exists)

**Step 4: Verify dev environment**
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit demo page
# http://localhost:3000/demo

# Check what's already built
ls src/components/ui/
```

**Step 5: Start work**
- Follow PHASE2_PLAN.md "Agent Execution Protocol" section
- Update this file as you complete commits
- Create CONTINUE_SESSION.md if your session is ending mid-step

## Success Criteria

**Step 1:** âœ…
- [x] Tailwind CSS installed and working
- [x] Design tokens match COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md
- [x] Mock data created
- [x] Demo page exists
- [x] v0 pages archived

**Step 2:** â¬œ (Pending)
- [ ] Avatar component works (all 9 variants)
- [ ] EntryChip component works (all 5 status variants)
- [ ] Both components in demo page
- [ ] Visual comparison confirms pixel-perfect match

---

## Important Context

**Tailwind Version:**
- Using v4.1.14 (NOT v3!)
- CSS-based config (@theme in globals.css)
- PostCSS plugin architecture

**Design Source:**
- COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md is source of truth
- Reference sections by name (not line numbers)
- Figma Components page: Node ID 177:32228

**Development Approach:**
- Extract â†’ Reference â†’ Build â†’ Verify workflow
- Mock data first, real Supabase later
- Demo page for isolated testing
- Mobile-first (320-767px priority)
