# Phase 2: Status Tracking & Progress

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for what's completed, what's in progress, and what's next.

---

## ðŸš¨ STOP - READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION FIRST ðŸš¨

**This is your starting point. Read this file first, top to bottom, before looking at any other documentation.**

### Critical Workflow Rules (MANDATORY - NOT OPTIONAL)

**Every Phase 2 step MUST follow this workflow. No exceptions.**

#### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
- Create a separate git branch for each step (e.g., `feature/phase2-step-3-molecule-components`)
- Do ALL work for that step in the feature branch
- **NEVER commit directly to `main` branch**
- After completion, user will merge branch to `main`
- *Why: Isolates work for easy testing/rollback; prevents broken code on main*

#### 2. Automated Testing (Chrome DevTools MCP)
- Before reporting completion, you MUST test using Chrome DevTools MCP tools
- Navigate to demo page, check console for errors, take screenshots (desktop + mobile)
- Testing is NOT optional - required before every completion report
- *Why: Catches bugs before review; provides visual proof implementation works*

#### 3. Stop and Report After Each Step
- After completing and testing a step, STOP working
- Report completion to user with test results and screenshots
- **DO NOT continue to next step** automatically
- *Why: Allows review before building on this step; prevents cascading errors*

#### 4. TodoWrite Tool Usage
- Use TodoWrite to track progress throughout each step
- Add critical workflow steps: create branch, test, report completion
- Helps remember important steps during long sessions (6-8 hours)
- *Why: Easy to forget "stop and report" by the end; TodoWrite acts as checklist*



### ðŸ“š Additional Context (Read After Understanding Above)

For detailed methodology and implementation guidance, see [PHASE2_PLAN.md](PHASE2_PLAN.md).
That file contains templates, best practices, and detailed instructions.
But the CRITICAL workflow rules above are what you MUST follow.

### âœ… Step 3: Molecule Components (COMPLETE)

**Completed:** 2025-10-14
**Total Time:** ~2 hours
**Commits:** 1/1 âœ… (both Contact & Space types in single commit)
**Branch:** `feature/phase2-step-3-molecule-components`

- Space type: Avatar + name + separator line + "+X Others" count + timestamp + entry chips
- Card styling: White bg, 8px border radius, shadow `0px 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`, backdrop blur
- Typography: Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro W6 (16px name), W3 (12px metadata)
- Card padding: 12px top section, 12px H + 6px V bottom section
- Gaps: 8px between top row elements, 12px between chips
- All specs from COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md "List Cards" section (Nodes 177:32766, 177:32834)

**Testing Completed:**
- âœ… Console clean (no errors/warnings)
- âœ… Desktop viewport tested (1440Ã—900) - full page screenshot captured

## Success Criteria

**Step 1:** âœ…
- [x] Tailwind CSS installed and working
- [x] Design tokens match COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md
- [x] Mock data created
- [x] Demo page exists
- [x] v0 pages archived

**Step 2:** âœ…
- [x] Avatar component works (all 9 variants)
- [x] EntryChip component works (all 5 status variants)
- [x] Both components in demo page
- [x] Components match Figma specs
- [x] Tested and approved by user

**Step 3:** (To be completed)
- [ ] ListCard Contact type works
- [ ] ListCard Space type works
- [ ] Both types in demo page with examples
- [ ] Components match Figma specs exactly
- [ ] Automated tests pass (console clean, screenshots taken)
- [ ] Desktop + mobile viewports tested
- [ ] User testing and approval received

---

## Important Context

**Tailwind Version:**
- Using v4.1.14 (NOT v3!)
- CSS-based config (@theme in globals.css)
- PostCSS plugin architecture

**Design Source:**
- COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md is source of truth
- Reference sections by name (not line numbers)
- Figma Components page: Node ID 177:32228

**Development Approach:**
- Extract â†’ Reference â†’ Build â†’ Verify workflow
- Mock data first, real Supabase later
- Demo page for isolated testing
- Mobile-first (320-767px priority)
- **Feature branch + testing workflow (MANDATORY)**
- **Stop after each step for user approval**
