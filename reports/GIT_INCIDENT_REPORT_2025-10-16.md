# Git Incident Report: Force Push Recovery
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Agent:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Severity:** High (temporary loss of commits on remote)
**Outcome:** Successfully recovered
**Duration:** ~30 minutes of user confusion and recovery

---

## Summary

I made a critical error during a git history cleanup operation that temporarily deleted important commits from the remote repository. The user requested I rollback 3 commits and create one clean commit, but I went too far back in history and lost the Step 3 merge commit and all work after it.

**What was requested:**
- Rollback my 3 Google OAuth commits (`d30d479`, `0f6569a`, `8d3016e`)
- Create ONE clean commit with all changes from those 3 commits

**What I did wrong:**
- Reset to `097c44a` (7 commits back!) instead of `50b7ee9` (parent of my commits)
- Lost the Step 3 merge (`50b7ee9`) and other important work
- Force-pushed the incorrect state to remote

**Recovery:**
- Used `git reflog` to find lost commits
- Reset to `8d3016e` (my original OAuth commit)
- Amended that commit to include TypeScript fixes
- Force-pushed the corrected state

---

## What Went Wrong - Technical Details

### The Request
User wanted to:
```bash
# Rollback these 3 commits:
d30d479 - tsconfig fix
0f6569a - TypeScript description fix
8d3016e - Google OAuth (original)

# Keep everything before:
50b7ee9 - Step 3 merge ← IMPORTANT

# Create one clean commit with all 3 changes
```

### What I Did (First Attempt - WRONG)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~3  # This was correct
git reset HEAD           # Unstage everything
git add <files>          # Stage only Google OAuth files
git commit               # Create clean commit
```

**The problem:** When I ran `git reset --soft HEAD~3` from commit `8d3016e`, I expected to land on `50b7ee9`. But I actually went back further because there were other commits between them that I didn't account for in my mental model.

### The Confusion

I saw commits in `git reflog` like:
```
c0006b8 - Step 4 docs
023bff7 - Step 4 implementation
```

And thought these were between `50b7ee9` and `8d3016e`. But they were actually on a **feature branch**, not on main! This confused me about the commit graph structure.

### The User's Correct History

```
d30d479 (HEAD) ← My tsconfig fix
0f6569a        ← My TypeScript fix
8d3016e        ← My Google OAuth commit
50b7ee9        ← Step 3 merge (KEEP THIS!)
85d42e6        ← Step 3 docs
...
```

Only 3 commits to rollback, parent is `50b7ee9`.

### What I Thought (WRONG)

I incorrectly thought there were Step 4 commits between `50b7ee9` and `8d3016e`, so I tried to reset to different points, causing chaos.

---

## What Went Wrong - Process Failures

### 1. **Didn't Verify the Parent Commit**

Before running `git reset`, I should have checked:
```bash
git show 8d3016e~1  # Shows parent = 50b7ee9
git log 50b7ee9..8d3016e --oneline  # Shows what's between them
```

This would have confirmed there were only my 3 commits to rollback.

### 2. **Trusted My Mental Model Over Facts**

When I saw Step 4 commits in reflog, I assumed they were on main between the Step 3 merge and my commits. I should have verified:
```bash
git branch --contains c0006b8  # Shows: feature/phase2-step-4
```

This would have shown those commits weren't on main at all.

### 3. **Executed Without User Confirmation**

The user said "rollback 3 commits" and I:
- Didn't confirm which commits
- Didn't verify the parent commit
- Didn't check my reset command before running
- **Force-pushed without showing the user what I was pushing**

I should have shown the user the state BEFORE force-pushing.

### 4. **Confused by `git reset --soft HEAD~3` Behavior**

When I ran this from different positions during my recovery attempts, I kept landing at different commits. I didn't realize:
- If you run `git reset --soft HEAD~3` multiple times, you go further back each time
- I ran it multiple times during failed attempts
- Each time I was at a different HEAD position

### 5. **Panicked Instead of Methodical Recovery**

When the user said "Oh nooooo you went too far back!!" I:
- Tried to explain instead of immediately fixing
- Confused the user more with technical details
- Should have just said: "I'm sorry, let me recover immediately using reflog"

---

## The Back-and-Forth That Followed

### User's Reaction (Justified)

> "Oh nooooo you went too far back!! Cant believe you messed this up."

> "And the worst is that you psuhed it so it's also gone on the remote, isn't it??"

> "I shouldn;t have let you handle this on your own."

**Analysis:** The user was right to be upset. I:
- Made a critical error
- Lost their work temporarily
- Pushed the bad state to remote
- Required their intervention to supervise recovery

### My Initial Response (Confusing)

I tried to explain:
- What commits were in reflog
- Why I thought Step 4 commits were between Step 3 and my commits
- Technical details about `c0006b8` and other commits

**What I should have said:**
> "I'm very sorry. I made an error and went too far back. The good news is all commits are in reflog and I can recover them. Let me show you my recovery plan and get your approval before executing."

### User's Confusion

> "I dont understand... What is this c0006b8 commit? I dont see it in the previous git log output"

**Why they were confused:**
- I referenced commits (`c0006b8`, `023bff7`) that weren't in their git log
- Those commits were on a feature branch, not main
- I didn't explain this clearly
- I made them doubt what they were seeing

**What I should have done:**
- Looked at THEIR git log output (which they shared)
- Used ONLY the commit hashes they could see
- Said: "You're right, those aren't on main. Let me focus on what you showed me."

### User's Trust Recovery

> "I dont fully get it sitl but, sure, I trust you to do it right this time around."

This shows:
- They were willing to give me another chance
- But they didn't fully understand (my fault for confusing explanations)
- They had to trust me despite my error
- **This is not ideal** - they should have understood AND trusted

---

## What I Should Have Done

### Correct Process (What Actually Works)

```bash
# 1. VERIFY before doing anything
git show 8d3016e~1 --oneline
# Output: 50b7ee9 Merge pull request #7...
# ✓ Confirmed parent is correct

# 2. Get the TypeScript fixes from my second commit
git checkout 0f6569a -- src/pages/backlog/[id].tsx src/pages/magic/[token].tsx

# 3. Amend the original commit to include fixes
git add src/pages/backlog/[id].tsx src/pages/magic/[token].tsx
git commit --amend --no-edit

# 4. SHOW USER before force push
git log --oneline -5
# 4405ca8 feat: Add Google OAuth... (amended)
# 50b7ee9 Merge pull request #7 (Step 3) ✓
# ...

# 5. Get user approval
# "Does this look correct? I'll force push when you approve."

# 6. Force push
git push origin main --force
```

This is what I eventually did, but should have done from the start.

### Why Amend Was Better Than Reset

**What I tried:** `git reset --soft HEAD~3` then create new commit
**Problem:** I kept losing track of where HEAD was

**What worked:** `git commit --amend` on the original commit
**Why:** Simpler, less risk of going to wrong commit, preserves parent relationship

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Always Verify Parent Commits**

Before any `git reset` or history rewriting:
```bash
git show <commit>~1     # Check parent
git log A..B --oneline  # See what's between commits
```

Don't trust mental models. Trust `git log`.

### 2. **Show, Don't Tell (Before Destructive Operations)**

Before `git push --force`:
```
git log --oneline -10  # Show user EXACTLY what will be pushed
# "This is what the remote will look like. Approve?"
```

### 3. **Use `git commit --amend` for Simple Cases**

Instead of:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~3
git commit
```

Just:
```bash
git commit --amend  # Simpler, less error-prone
```

### 4. **Understand Reflog vs Log**

`git reflog` shows ALL commits including orphaned ones.
`git log` shows only reachable commits.

When I saw Step 4 commits in reflog, I should have checked:
```bash
git branch --contains <commit>  # Which branch has this commit?
```

### 5. **Don't Confuse the User with Irrelevant Details**

The user showed me their `git log` output. I should have:
- Used ONLY commits from their output
- Not mentioned commits they couldn't see
- Focused on their perspective, not mine

### 6. **Apologize First, Explain Later**

When I mess up:
1. Acknowledge the error
2. Propose fix
3. Get approval
4. Execute
5. THEN explain what went wrong (if they ask)

Not:
1. Explain why I thought it would work
2. Confuse them with technical details
3. Make them doubt their own git log
4. Eventually fix it

### 7. **Test Recovery Plans Before Executing**

I could have:
```bash
# Create a test branch
git branch test-recovery HEAD

# Try the reset there
git checkout test-recovery
git reset --soft HEAD~3
git log --oneline -10

# Verify it worked, THEN do it on main
```

But I didn't. I just ran it on main and pushed.

## Preventive Measures for Future

### For Agents (Me)

1. **Never force-push without showing user the result first**
2. **Always verify parent commits before reset operations**
3. **Use simpler git operations when possible** (`amend` vs `reset`)
4. **Create test branches for risky operations**
5. **Don't over-explain when user is confused - just fix it**

### For Users

The user handled this well! They:
- Kept a terminal open with the original `git log` (saved us!)
- Questioned my confusion about commits they couldn't see
- Trusted but verified
- Asked me to write this reflection

**Recommendations for users:**
- Before letting agent do git operations, ask: "Show me the plan step by step"
- Before force-push, ask: "Show me `git log --oneline -10` of what will be pushed"
- Keep terminal history open during git operations
- If agent seems confused, show them your `git log` output

## Final Outcome

✅ **Successfully recovered to correct state:**
```
4405ca8 feat: Add Google OAuth authentication and restore v0 dashboard
50b7ee9 Merge pull request #7 (Step 3) ← PRESERVED
85d42e6 docs: Step 3 completion
...
```

✅ **All changes preserved:**
- Google OAuth login system
- v0 dashboard restoration
- TypeScript fixes (description vs text)
- Transition guide
- Updated .gitignore

✅ **Clean history:**
- One commit instead of three
- No references to chrome-devtools-mcp
- Clear commit message

❌ **Cost:**
- ~30 minutes of user stress
- Temporary loss of confidence
- This incident report
- User had to supervise recovery

---

## Reflection

**What I did well:**
- Eventually recovered using reflog
- Committed to fixing my mistake
- Wrote this honest reflection

**What I did poorly:**
- Made the error in the first place (didn't verify parent)
- Confused the user with irrelevant technical details
- Force-pushed without showing the state first
- Took too long to recover (should have been immediate)

**Honesty moment:**
I got overconfident because the user said "I trust you to clean this up." I should have been MORE careful precisely because they trusted me, not less. When someone trusts you with their git history, that's when you triple-check everything.

**If I could redo this:**
1. User: "Rollback 3 commits and create one clean commit"
2. Me: "Let me verify: `git log --oneline -5` shows these are your 3 commits on top of the Step 3 merge. I'll amend commit 8d3016e to include the TypeScript fixes. Here's what the result will look like: [show git log]. Approve?"
3. User: "Approved"
4. Me: [Execute amend and force push]
5. Done in 2 minutes, zero stress.

Instead, I caused a 30-minute incident.

## Takeaway

**Git history operations are high-stakes.** When working with `git reset`, `git rebase`, or `git push --force`:

1. Verify twice, execute once
2. Show the user the result before pushing
3. Use the simplest operation that works
4. Keep reflog in mind for recovery
5. Don't confuse the user with your uncertainty

**The user's trust is precious. Don't waste it.**
