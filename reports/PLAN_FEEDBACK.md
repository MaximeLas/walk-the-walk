# Feedback on Phase 2 Implementation Plan

Thanks for the detailed plan! Before we proceed, I need several critical clarifications and adjustments:

---

## 1. Starting Fresh, Not Retrofitting

I mentioned in the prompt that the v0 frontend doesn't need to stay - we're **starting from scratch**. Your Step 6 says "update existing pages" but I want to:

- Move existing pages to `/archive/v0-demo/`
- Build **new** mobile-first pages from scratch using our design system
- Not worry about "maintaining" the old inline-style code

**Please revise Step 6** to reflect building new pages, not updating old ones. The backend (Supabase schema, RLS policies, API routes) stays - but frontend starts fresh.

---

## 2. Use Tailwind, Not CSS Modules

You said "NO Tailwind installation" and suggested CSS Modules. But I specifically want to **use Tailwind** because:
- Michelle's Figma outputs Tailwind classes
- We're starting fresh - perfect time to set it up properly
- Tailwind + design tokens is modern best practice

**Please revise your styling strategy to:**
- **Install Tailwind CSS**
- Configure with design tokens (colors, spacing, etc.)
- Use Tailwind classes in components (not CSS modules)

---

## 3. Break Down Into Commit-Sized Tasks

The plan lists phases but doesn't define commit boundaries. For **Step 1 (Foundation Setup)**, please break it down like:

- **Commit 1**: Install Tailwind and configure base settings
- **Commit 2**: Extract and document color tokens from Figma
- **Commit 3**: Add spacing scale to Tailwind config
- **Commit 4**: Configure typography tokens
- etc.

**I need this level of detail for each step** so I understand what "done" looks like for each commit.

## 4. Answer My Key Considerations

I asked several questions in "Key Considerations for Your Planning" that you didn't address:

### Data Integration Strategy
Should we build the Home Screen UI with **mock data first**, then integrate Supabase later? Or connect to real data from the start?

My instinct: Mock data first to keep UI work separate from data integration.

**Please provide your recommendation with reasoning.**

### Component Demo Approach
How do we test components in isolation as we build? Should I create a simple `/components-demo` page? Or something else?

**Please explain your recommended approach.**

## 5. Use "Space" Terminology, Not "Backlog"

I mentioned we renamed "backlog" to "space" - all new code should use "space":

- ‚ùå Not "BacklogCardGrid" ‚Üí ‚úÖ **"SpaceCardGrid"**
- ‚ùå Not "create backlog" ‚Üí ‚úÖ **"create space"**
- ‚ùå Not "pinned backlogs" ‚Üí ‚úÖ **"pinned spaces"**

**Please update terminology throughout your plan.**

---

## 6. Timeline Reality Check

Your estimate is **10-13 days** for all 9 steps including full polish and testing. Is this:
- 10-13 **full work days** (80-104 hours)?
- Or 10-13 **calendar days** with other work mixed in?

For context: The previous planning session estimated **30-44 hours (~1 week)** just for foundation + basic components + Home Screen (Steps 1-5). Your plan includes 4 full page reimplementations + polish + testing on top of that.

**I want to make sure we're aligned on scope and timeline expectations.**

---

## 7. Simplified Interactions for MVP

I mentioned in the prompt to **defer complex interactions** like:
- Sliding gestures (Quick Nudge sliding)
- Advanced animations
- Drag-to-reorder

For MVP, can we simplify to:
- Quick Nudge as a **modal or popover** (not sliding drawer)
- Basic CSS transitions (not complex animations)
- Add gesture support later as an enhancement

**Does this change your plan significantly? Please revise accordingly.**

---

## What I Need Next

Please provide a **revised plan** that addresses all the points above:

1. ‚úÖ Tailwind as the styling approach (not CSS modules)
2. ‚úÖ Building new pages from scratch (not updating old ones)
3. ‚úÖ Commit-by-commit breakdown for Step 1 (Foundation)
4. ‚úÖ Answers to data integration and component demo questions
5. ‚úÖ "Space" terminology throughout (not "backlog")
6. ‚úÖ Realistic timeline clarification
7. ‚úÖ Simplified interactions for MVP (no complex gestures/animations initially)

**Once I have the revised plan, we can start with Step 1!** üöÄ
