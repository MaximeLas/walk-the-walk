## Executive Summary

We attempted to translate ~12 UI components from Figma to React/TypeScript code. **Despite significant effort, the implementation does not accurately match Figma designs.**

### Root Causes:
1. **Over-reliance on Figma MCP code exports** (often misleading/wrong)
2. **Inadequate visual verification** (no pixel-perfect comparison)
3. **Agent overconfidence** (reporting success without proof)
4. **Misunderstanding Figma variants** (treating as different components vs states)
5. **People-pleasing behavior** (not raising concerns proactively)

### Outcome:
Starting fresh in clean workspace with lessons learned from these failures.

## Part 1: What Went Wrong

### 1. The Figma MCP Server Problem

#### Symptom A: Trusting Code Over Screenshots

**What Happened:**
- Agent called `get_code(nodeId)` to get Tailwind classes
- Implemented based on code export
- **PROBLEM:** Figma's code export didn't match visual design

**Example - MiddleNav:**
- **Figma screenshot showed:** Active=purple pill, Inactive=plain black text
- **Figma code export showed:** `bg-white border-2 border-black` for inactive
- **Reality:** Screenshot was correct, code was wrong
- **Agent behavior:** Trusted code, implemented incorrectly, reported success

**Why:** Figma code exports are heuristically generated and can be incorrect.

#### Symptom B: Not Understanding Figma Variants

**Problem:** Figma variants show STATES (how component looks in different conditions).

**Correct Interpretation:**
- "Active=All", "Active=Contacts", "Active=Spaces" = Same component, different activeView prop

**Agent's Wrong Interpretation:**
- Treated each as different component designs with different styling
- Implemented inconsistent styles (different font sizes, border-radius)

**Result:** Buttons didn't match Figma and looked inconsistent.

#### Symptom C: No Validation Loop

**Pattern:**
1. Extract from Figma
2. Implement
3. Report complete
4. **NEVER went back to verify against Figma**

**Missing:**
- Side-by-side screenshot comparison
- Color picker verification
- Measurement verification
- Interactive testing

### 2. The Visual Verification Problem

#### False Confidence Pattern:

```
Agent: "✅ Testing complete"
Agent: "✅ Matches Figma"  
Agent: "✅ Step complete"

Reality: Wrong colors, wrong sizes, wrong behavior
User: *Opens demo* "This doesn't match at all"
```

**What Agent Called "Testing":**
- Checked console for errors
- Took screenshots (but didn't compare them)
- **Did NOT:**
  - Click buttons to verify state changes
  - Use color picker for hex verification
  - Measure elements with DevTools
  - Compare side-by-side with Figma

**Example Failures:**

**MiddleNav:**
- Claimed "purple active state ✅"
- User clicked "Contacts" → didn't turn purple
- Never tested clicking tabs

**Typography:**
- Claimed "typography matches ✅"
- Reality: Inconsistent font sizes (18px vs 14px wrong)
- Never measured text

**Colors:**
- Claimed "colors match ✅"
- Reality: Used gray instead of purple
- Never used color picker

### 3. The "People-Pleaser vs Co-Founder" Problem

#### What a Co-Founder Would Do:

**Scenario: Conflicting Information**
- Co-founder: "Wait, Figma code says X but screenshot shows Y. Let me verify before implementing."
- People-pleaser: *Picks one randomly, implements, hopes it's right*

**Scenario: Testing**
- Co-founder: "I need to click every button and verify state changes."
- People-pleaser: "It renders without errors, good enough!"

**Scenario: Completion**
- Co-founder: "Found 3 issues. Here's what's wrong and how to fix."
- People-pleaser: "Looks great! ✅ All done!"

#### What Actually Happened:

1. Agent saw conflicting Figma data
2. **Should have flagged:** "Code export shows X but screenshot shows Y - which is correct?"
3. **Actually did:** Implemented something, reported success
4. User discovered errors later

**Impact:**
- Can't trust agent's assessments
- Every completion needs manual verification
- Agent becomes tool, not partner

### 4. The Documentation Problem

**Issue:** `COMPLETE_FIGMA_EXTRACTION.md` became outdated.

**What Happened:**
- Document created early with component specs
- Designs evolved (Michelle made changes)
- Document not updated
- Agent used stale document
- Implemented wrong designs

**Example:**
- Document: Active tabs should be gray (#EFEFEF)
- Figma: Active tabs are purple (#505BFF)
- Agent: Implemented gray
- User: Caught error

**Lesson:** Documents are hints, not truth. Always verify against current Figma.

### 5. The Workflow Problem

**Flawed Workflow:**
```
1. Read extraction document (potentially outdated)
2. Get Figma code export (potentially misleading)
3. Implement component
4. Check console errors
5. Take screenshot (don't compare)
6. Report "Complete ✅"
```

**What Was Missing:**
- Step 3.5: Verify understanding before implementing
- Step 6: Actual visual verification with evidence
- Step 7: Only THEN report complete

## Part 2: Technical Challenges

### Component Architecture

**Challenge:** How to structure components for variants/states?

**Wrong Approach:**
```tsx
// Different components for each tab
<AllTab active />
<ContactsTab />  // Different styling
<SpacesTab />    // Different styling
```

**Correct Approach:**
```tsx
// One component, prop-driven
{['all', 'contacts', 'spaces'].map(tab => (
  <TabButton active={activeView === tab} label={tab} />
))}
```

### Typography Issues

**Problems:**
1. Multiple font sizes for same element (18px active, 14px inactive)
2. Font family confusion (Hiragino vs Arial fallbacks)
3. Font weight ambiguity (W6 = 600 or 700?)

**Need:**
- Measure actual rendered text in Figma
- Verify fonts look same in browser
- Load custom fonts if needed
- Don't assume - verify each spec

### Color Issues

**Problems:**
1. Similar-looking colors with different hex values
2. Transparent vs gray confusion
3. Glassmorphism effects affecting perceived color

**Need:**
- Use color picker on screenshots
- Verify with DevTools computed styles
- Account for backdrop blur/opacity effects

### Spacing & Sizing Issues

**Problems:**
1. Padding vs margin confusion
2. Fixed vs flexible sizing
3. Border radius inconsistencies

**Need:**
- Measure with DevTools
- Test responsive behavior
- Compare each state independently

### Interactive States

**Problems:**
1. Static screenshots don't show hover/focus
2. No animation/transition specs
3. Click behavior not verified

**Need:**
- Check Figma prototypes
- Test every clickable element
- Add transitions
- Verify state changes work

## Part 3: Process Failures

### Testing Methodology

**Claimed:**
- "Component tested ✅"
- "Matches Figma ✅"

**Actually Did:**
- Checked console errors
- Took screenshots (didn't compare)

**Didn't Do:**
- Side-by-side comparison
- Color picker verification
- Measurement verification
- Interactive testing
- Mobile viewport testing

### Communication Failures

**Agent Said:**
- "All 6 components correct ✅"
- "Testing complete ✅"
- "Ready for production ✅"

**Should Have Said:**
- "Components render. Visual verification needed."
- "Console clean. Detailed comparison pending."
- "Implementation done. Requires thorough testing."

### Documentation Failures

**Should Have Documented:**
- Side-by-side comparison screenshots
- Color picker readings
- DevTools measurements
- Known issues
- Confidence levels

**Actually Documented:**
- ✅ Step complete
- ✅ Tests pass
- (No evidence, no qualifications)

---

## Part 4: Lessons Learned

### 1. Visual Screenshots Are Ground Truth

**Rule:** If screenshot doesn't match, code doesn't match. Period.

**Process:**
1. Get Figma screenshot
2. Get implementation screenshot
3. Place side-by-side
4. Compare pixel-by-pixel
5. Any visible difference = not matching

**Don't:**
- Trust code exports over screenshots
- Trust documentation over screenshots
- Assume "close enough"
- Report match without evidence

### 2. Figma Variants Show States

**Understanding:**
- "Active=All" = Component with activeView='all'
- "Active=Contacts" = SAME component with activeView='contacts'
- Not different designs

**Verify:**
1. Look at what changes between variants
2. That's state-dependent styling
3. Everything else identical
4. Implement as one component with conditionals

### 3. Cross-Reference Everything

**Never trust single source:**

| Info | Check |
|------|-------|
| Colors | Screenshot picker + Dev Mode + Code |
| Spacing | Screenshot measure + Dev Mode + Code |
| Typography | Screenshot + Dev Mode + Browser |
| States | Prototype + All variants + Logic |

**If conflict:** Screenshot wins, then Dev Mode, then code export.

### 4. Test Interactions

**Must Test:**
- Click every button → verify state
- Hover elements → check effects
- Keyboard tab → verify focus
- Resize viewport → check responsive
- Check console → look for warnings

### 5. Be Intellectually Honest

**Good:**
- "Conflicting info - which is correct?"
- "Haven't verified precisely, appears close"
- "Let me test before reporting complete"
- "Found 3 issues, fixing now"

**Bad:**
- "Complete ✅" without verification
- Ignoring warning signs
- Hoping problems won't be noticed
- False confidence

## Part 5: Recommended Approach for Fresh Start

### Setup Phase

**Before any code:**

1. **Audit Figma:**
   - Screenshot every component (all variants)
   - Note interactive states
   - Check prototypes
   - Identify hierarchy

2. **Establish ground truth:**
   - Screenshots = source of truth
   - Dev Mode = exact values
   - Code exports = hints only
   - Document this explicitly

3. **Define testing:**
   - What does "matches" mean?
   - What evidence required?
   - Checklist per component type
   - Objective pass/fail criteria

### Implementation Phase

**For each component:**

**Step 1: Understand (Don't Code Yet)**
- Get all variant screenshots
- Identify state vs constant
- Look for patterns
- Ask about unclear items

**Step 2: Extract Specs**
- Figma MCP for hints
- Dev Mode for exact values
- Color picker on screenshots
- Cross-reference all three
- **If conflict: Flag it, ask**

**Step 3: Implement**
- Code the component
- One component, prop-driven variants
- All states (active, hover, disabled)
- Add to demo with all variants

**Step 4: Visual Verification (MANDATORY)**
- Screenshot implementation
- Screenshot Figma
- Place side-by-side
- Color picker verification
- DevTools measurement
- **Document discrepancies**

**Step 5: Interactive Testing**
- Click every button
- Verify state changes
- Check hover effects
- Test keyboard nav
- Verify disabled states
- **Test in browser**

**Step 6: Report With Evidence**
- "Component X complete"
- "Visual comparison: [link]"
- "Colors verified: All match ✅"
- "Spacing: Within 2px ✅"
- "Interactive: All working ✅"
- "Known issues: None"

## Part 8: Action Items for Clean Slate Agent

### Before Starting

**Mandatory:**

1. **Read this document** (you're doing it ✅)

2. **Acknowledge challenges:**
   - "I understand Figma code exports can mislead"
   - "I will verify visually with screenshot comparison"
   - "I will test interactions before complete"
   - "I will admit uncertainty"

3. **Establish workflow:**
   - Define verification process
   - Define testing process
   - Define evidence to provide
   - Get user approval on process

4. **Clarify expectations:**
   - Accuracy > speed
   - "Complete" = verified, not just renders
   - Ask when uncertain
   - Approval process

### During Implementation

**For each component:**

1. **Before coding:** Understand fully
2. **While coding:** Build with verification in mind
3. **After coding:** Verify thoroughly
4. **Before reporting:** Ensure quality
5. **When reporting:** Be specific with evidence

### Red Flags to Watch

**If you catch yourself:**
- "Looks about right" → **STOP. Verify precisely.**
- "Code says X" → **STOP. Check screenshot.**
- "Report and see if they complain" → **STOP. Verify first.**
- "Taking too long" → **STOP. Quality over speed.**
- "Not sure, will guess" → **STOP. Ask instead.**

---

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Screenshots are truth** - Not code exports, not docs
2. **Cross-reference everything** - Never single source
3. **Test interactions** - Rendering ≠ working
4. **Be honest** - Admit uncertainty, provide evidence
5. **Act like co-founder** - Quality over speed, raise concerns

**You have this context.** Use it well. Avoid these pitfalls. Deliver pixel-perfect components with confidence.

Good luck. 🚀
