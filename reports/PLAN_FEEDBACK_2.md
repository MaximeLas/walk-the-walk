# Additional Strategic Feedback on Revised Plan

Great revision! Before we start, I need to clarify some strategic priorities and establish how we'll handle evolving requirements.

---

## 1. Mobile-First is THE Priority (Not Just "Mobile-First")

**Important context**: Michelle designed exclusively for mobile web because:
- Most users will use the app on mobile
- It's easier to scale UP from mobile â†’ desktop than DOWN from desktop â†’ mobile
- Mobile web is our MVP target

**What this means for implementation**:
- **Primary focus**: Ensure mobile web (320-767px) functions **perfectly**
- **Desktop/tablet**: Implement something basic that doesn't break, but **don't spend significant time** on desktop-specific layouts or optimizations
- **Testing priority**: Mobile web is where 90% of testing effort should go

**Specifically**:
- Don't over-engineer responsive breakpoints for tablet/desktop
- Simple, working layouts for larger screens are fine (e.g., just center the mobile layout with max-width)
- We'll redesign desktop experience later when Michelle creates those designs
- Time spent perfecting desktop layouts now is likely wasted (we'll redo it anyway)

**Please adjust your plan to reflect this**: Mobile web perfection, desktop "good enough for now."

## 2. Testing Should Mirror This Priority

Your testing plan should be:
- **90% mobile web**: Test thoroughly on iPhone SE, iPhone 14 Pro, Android phones
- **10% desktop/tablet**: Quick smoke tests to ensure nothing breaks (basic display, navigation works)

**Don't spend time on**:
- Pixel-perfect desktop layouts
- Complex responsive behavior testing across all breakpoints
- Desktop-specific interaction patterns

**We will revisit desktop** when Michelle designs for it. Right now, it's not worth the investment.

## 3. Designs and Requirements Are Still Evolving

**Reality check**: Michelle is still designing, and requirements will change in the coming days/weeks.

**This means**:
- The task list you created is **not set in stone**
- New screens will be added
- Existing screens may be modified
- Priorities may shift based on user feedback or co-founder discussions

**I need you to think about**: How do we handle this iteratively and robustly?

### Questions for You:

1. **How should I communicate changes to you?**
   - Should I update a specific file (e.g., `CHANGES.md`) with new requirements from Michelle?
   - Or just tell you directly in conversation?

2. **How do we modify the plan when requirements change?**
   - If Michelle adds a new screen, how do we slot it into the current plan?
   - If she modifies an existing screen, how do we adjust in-progress or completed work?

3. **How do we maintain consistency?**
   - What's the process for evaluating new information?
   - How do we decide what to prioritize when changes come in?
   - How do we avoid rework or scope creep?

**Please propose a methodology** for handling evolving requirements that is:
- **Consistent**: Same process each time
- **Robust**: Carefully evaluates what's new vs. what's already done
- **Flexible**: Can adapt to changes without derailing progress
- **Clear**: I know exactly how to communicate changes to you

## 4. Clarifications from Previous Message

### Magic Link Recipient View
I noticed the plan includes Home Screen and Space Detail Page, but doesn't mention the **Magic Link recipient view** (`/magic/[token]`), which is critical for our product. Where does this fit?
- Is it part of Step 6 (Space Detail)?
- Or should it be a separate step?

### Commit Breakdown for Step 2+
Step 1 has detailed commit-by-commit breakdown, but Steps 2-6 don't. Can you provide the same level of detail for Step 2 (Atomic Components) before we start? Or should we tackle that when we finish Step 1?

### Testing Plan
The original plan had Step 9 for accessibility testing, performance validation, and cross-browser testing. I don't see that in the revised plan. Is this:
- Deferred until after Step 6?
- Or integrated into each step as we go?

## What I Need From You

Before we start Step 1, please provide:

1. **Revised approach** that reflects:
   - Mobile web as 90% priority (desktop is "good enough, not perfect")
   - Testing focused on mobile (quick smoke tests only for desktop)

2. **Change management methodology**:
   - How I should communicate new requirements from Michelle
   - How we'll evaluate and incorporate changes into the plan
   - Process for maintaining consistency as requirements evolve

3. **Answers to clarifications**:
   - Magic link view placement
   - Step 2+ commit breakdown (now or later?)
   - Testing approach (integrated or separate step?)

**Once you've addressed these, we're ready to start!** ðŸš€

**Important Note**: I'm excited to get started, but I want to make sure we have a solid process in place for handling the inevitable changes that will come as Michelle continues designing and we iterate with users. Let's set that foundation now so we're not scrambling later.
