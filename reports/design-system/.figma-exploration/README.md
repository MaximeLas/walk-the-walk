# Figma Exploration Documentation

This folder contains documented explorations of Figma components during the design-to-code translation process.

## Purpose

Each exploration session is saved in a timestamped folder containing:
- Screenshots of Figma components
- Analysis notes documenting what we see
- Technical specifications extracted from Figma
- Questions and uncertainties to resolve
- Process documentation for learning

## Folder Structure

Each folder follows this naming convention:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_component-name_figma-node-id/
  ├── EXPLORATION_NOTES.md  - Main analysis and findings
  ├── LABELED_VIEW.md       - Documentation frame with labels (if applicable)
  └── [additional docs]     - Context-specific documentation
```

## Current Explorations

### 2025-10-15 21:56:59 - Button Component Set
- **Folder:** `20251015_215659_button-component-set_209-40930/`
- **Status:** Initial reconnaissance complete
- **Component:** Primary button component with 4 states × 3 icon positions
- **Next Steps:** Verify exact values with Inspect panel, clarify uncertainties with Max

## Why This Exists

This documentation serves multiple purposes:
1. **Learning Trail:** Helps Max understand the Figma exploration process
2. **Decision History:** Documents why we made certain choices
3. **Future Reference:** When revisiting components later, we remember our thinking
4. **Process Improvement:** Identify patterns in what works/doesn't work
5. **Onboarding:** Future team members can see how components were analyzed

## How to Use

When exploring a new Figma component:
1. Create timestamped folder with component name and node ID
2. Save screenshot(s) as they're captured
3. Document observations, questions, and uncertainties immediately
4. Note what tools were used and why
5. Flag conflicts between different data sources
6. Track decisions made during clarification with Max

This approach follows the **Evidence Over Assumptions** principle from our collaborative workflow.
