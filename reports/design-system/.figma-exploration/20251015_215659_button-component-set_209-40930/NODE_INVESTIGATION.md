# Node Investigation - Understanding Figma Structure

## The Problem

I need to understand which node IDs represent what in Figma's hierarchy. Let me systematically check.

## Node IDs We Know:

1. **209-40930** - You shared this first (second box from left, purple dashed border)
2. **209-41266** - You shared this second (wider frame with labels)
3. **209-44243** - Found in code export as "State=Primary, Icon=Left"

## Investigation Plan:

Let me check each node systematically to understand what they represent.
