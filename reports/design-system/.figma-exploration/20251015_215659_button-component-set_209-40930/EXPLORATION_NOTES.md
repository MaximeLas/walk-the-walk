# Button Component Set Exploration

**Date/Time:** 2025-10-15 21:56:59
**Figma Node ID:** 209-40930
**Component Type:** Button Component Set (dev-ready, indicated by purple dashed border)

## Context

This is our first deep dive into a Figma component. Max selected this as a good starting point - it appears to be the second component box from the left on the Components page, with a purple dashed border indicating it's ready for development.

## What I See (Visual Analysis)

The screenshot shows a button component set with **4 rows × 3 columns = 12 variants**:

### Rows (States):
1. **Primary** - Blue buttons with rounded corners
2. **Secondary** - Text-only buttons (no background)
3. **Disabled** - Gray/muted buttons
4. **Tapped** - Active/pressed state (one example shown in light blue/teal)

### Columns (Icon Configurations):
1. **No Icon** - Just text labels
2. **Icon Left** - Icon positioned to the left of text
3. **Icon Top** - Icon stacked above text

### Specific Button Examples Shown:
- "Save" - Most common label across variants
- "Import from Contacts" - Longer text example
- "Promise" - With asterisk icon
- "Contact" - In the Tapped state

## Technical Specs Extracted from `get_code` Output

### Design Tokens:
- **White:** `#fcfafa`
- **Neon Blue:** `#505bff` (primary button background)
- **Silver:** `#c8d3d5`

### Spacing:
- **Padding:** `px-12 py-16` (12px horizontal, 16px vertical)
- **Gap between icon and text:** `8px` (horizontal), `4px` (vertical/stacked)
- **Button height:** `48px`

### Typography:
- **Font size:** 14px (primary), 12px (some variants)
- **Font weight:** Bold
- **Text color:**
  - White (`#ffffff`) for Primary
  - Black for Secondary
  - Gray (`#646464`) for Disabled

### Icons:
- **Size:** 24px × 24px
- **Format:** SVG images served from localhost

### Border Radius:
Not explicitly stated in the code output - need to verify with Inspect panel

## Critical Observations & Flags

### ⚠️ Issues with Generated Code:
1. **Structure Problem:** Code uses giant if/else statements instead of clean prop-driven logic
2. **Missing Colors:** Primary button blue background not showing in code classes
3. **Font Declaration:** Uses invalid Tailwind syntax `font-['Arial:Bold']`
4. **Hardcoded Content:** Examples have specific text rather than accepting children
5. **Images for Icons:** Icons are image URLs rather than icon library components

### ✅ What's Useful:
- Spacing values appear consistent
- Typography sizes are clear
- Layout structure (flexbox, gaps) is understandable
- Color palette is extracted

## Questions/Uncertainties to Resolve:

1. **Border Radius:** What's the exact border-radius value? (appears rounded but not specified)
2. **Hover States:** Are there hover/focus states beyond what's shown? (Need to check Figma)
3. **Background Color Confusion:** Why doesn't the code show the blue background explicitly?
4. **Icon Source:** Should we use an icon library (like Heroicons, Lucide) or Michelle's custom icons?
5. **Tapped vs Active:** Is "Tapped" the same as `:active` state, or a persistent state?
6. **Text Wrapping:** How should long text behave? Truncate, wrap, or grow button?

## Next Steps in Our Workflow:

Following the **Phase 1: Understanding** workflow:

1. ✅ Got variant screenshots from Figma
2. ✅ Extracted specs from MCP code export
3. ⏳ Need to check Figma Inspect panel for exact values
4. ⏳ Identify what changes between variants (done visually, need to confirm)
5. ⏳ Share findings with Max and flag uncertainties
6. ⏳ Wait for Max's approval to proceed to implementation

## Recommendation:

**This Button component is a good starting point** because:
- Clear visual variants (not too complex)
- Common use case (buttons are fundamental)
- Well-documented by Michelle (labeled rows/columns)
- Dev-ready indicator (purple dashed border)

However, we need to:
- Verify exact color values with color picker
- Understand hover/focus states
- Clarify icon approach
- Get approval before implementing

## Source Reliability Assessment:

- **Screenshot (Primary):** ✅ Shows clear visual design
- **MCP Code Export (Tertiary):** ⚠️ Useful for hints but has structural issues
- **Inspect Panel (Secondary):** ⏳ Not checked yet - this will give us exact values

---

**Status:** Initial reconnaissance complete. Ready to discuss findings with Max and clarify uncertainties before moving to implementation.
