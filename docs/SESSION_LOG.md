## 2025-10-09: Second Brain System Design

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-09-second-brain-system-design.md](sessions/2025-10-09-second-brain-system-design.md)

**Summary:** Max wanted to preserve valuable AI conversation reasoning for future sessions. Led to designing complete "second brain" conversational memory system. Two fundamental operations identified: CREATE (record sessions) and FETCH (retrieve context). CREATE must be done by main agent (needs full conversation context). FETCH should be delegated to sub-agent via Task tool (fresh context window, more reliable, keeps main conversation clean). Split PROTOCOL.md (CREATE instructions) and RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md (FETCH instructions) to match separate operations. Designed SESSION_LOG.md as lightweight discovery layer - scan summaries/keywords first, then read only relevant full sessions (prevents token waste). Created slash commands: /record-session and /fetch-session. Key insight: main agent should expand user's brief fetch request using conversation context before passing to sub-agent (sub-agent has zero context). Minimized slash command content - just point to source of truth files, don't duplicate instructions. Discovered slash commands run in main agent context (not separate sub-agents) but should often invoke sub-agents for complex work. Very meta session - designed system for recording conversations, then used it to record the design conversation itself.

**Topics:** Knowledge management, AI-assisted development, system architecture, documentation design, workflow optimization, meta-cognition

**Key Decisions:**
- Build conversational memory system (preserve reasoning, not just decisions)
- Two operations architecture (CREATE and FETCH)
- CREATE by main agent, FETCH by sub-agent
- Split PROTOCOL.md and RETRIEVAL_GUIDE.md
- Use slash commands for deterministic invocation
- Main agent expands user's brief input for retrieval
- Minimize duplication, maximize source of truth

**Unresolved:** None - system complete

## 2025-10-08: Backlog Model Rethinking & Team Alignment

**File:** [sessions/2025-10-08-backlog-model-rethinking.md](sessions/2025-10-08-backlog-model-rethinking.md)

**Summary:** Max had initial insight that backlogs should represent contexts or projects rather than 1-to-1 person relationships. Through conversation with Claude, developed comprehensive arguments for context-centric "spaces" model. Explored why tags don't solve this problem - distinction between structural (backlogs define who sees what together) versus metadata (tags enable filtering and organization). Crafted message to co-founders Kevin and Michelle addressing anticipated "isn't this just Jira?" concern. Key arguments developed: cognitive load (structure in tool reduces structure in head), bilateral benefit (recipients who aren't users also get contextual visibility), magic links prove backlogs must be real entities (not just filtered views). Analyzed team meeting transcript where initial confusion about terminology versus concept resolved - everyone aligned on idea that multiple people can be in same backlog, same person can be in multiple backlogs. Decided to rename "backlog" to "space" based on Michelle's preference. Unresolved: exact MVP scope for multi-person spaces.

**Topics:** Product architecture, data modeling, team communication, UX design, product strategy, terminology, value proposition

**Key Decisions:**
- Use context-centric "spaces" instead of person-centric backlogs
- Rename "backlog" to "space"
- Backlogs/spaces should support multiple participants
- Same person can be in multiple spaces
- Person-centric view (contact view) aggregates across all spaces involving that person
- Need dedicated backlog-centric view (not synonymous with contact view)

**Unresolved:**
- Exact MVP scope (does multi-person ship in v1 or Phase 2?)
- Final confirmation on "space" terminology from full team
- UI design for backlog-centric view (Michelle working on it)

**Artifacts:**

- [message-to-cofounders.txt](../artifacts/message-to-cofounders.txt) - WhatsApp message explaining proposal
